	* libgettext.h: Removed, shouldn't be here.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted to remove libgettext.h

2000-09-15  Andrew V. Samoilov  <sav@bcs.zp.ua>

	* editcmd.c (edit_delete_macro, edit_(load|save)_macro_cmd): don't
	translate keywords written to macro file or macro don't work, at least
	for Cyrillic. Made this as separate commit, so, if it seriously breaks 
	compatibility it's easy to revert it.

2000-09-15  Andrew V. Samoilov  <sav@bcs.zp.ua>

	* editcmd.c (edit_save_file): fopen()+fwrite()+fclose() replaced
	by open()+write()+close() to restore possibility to edit files
	over Midnight Commander's VFSes
	
	(edit_replace_cmd) [MIDNIGHT]: some more right algorithm to calculate
	menu coordinates used. I don't like if menu hides replaced text.

	(edit_goto_cmd): Memory leaking fixed when f is empty string

2000-09-07  Andrew V. Samoilov  <sav@bcs.zp.ua>

	* edit.c (check_file_access) [MIDNIGHT,GTK]: error message localized;
	some cosmetics changes to avoid annoying warnings

	* editcmd.c (edit_save_file): pclose returns 0 on success, 
	file fclose()d when fwrite fails
	
	(pipe_mail): malloc () + sprintf () replaced by g_strdup_printf ()
	
	* syntax.c (syntax_text): Makefile replaced by [Mm]akefile to cover
	makefile and GNUmakefile
	(upgrade_syntax_file): infinitive loop fixed when rule file
	is outdated but it cannot be unlinked/overwritten

2000-08-30  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* editwidget.c [!MIDNIGHT]: include xdnd.h
	* Makefile.in: distribute xdnd.h

2000-08-18  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

2000-07-20  Andrew V. Samoilov  <sav@bcs.zp.ua>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c (edit_save_file): check fclose()s return value
	to prevent loss of data
	(edit_block_process_cmd): don't translate empty string

	* gtkedit/edit.h (edit_get_write_filter, edit_write_stream,
	edit_init_file): added declarations
