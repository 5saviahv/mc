This is the port of Midnight Commander for Win32.

The original code was contributed by
Juan Grigera <grigera@isis.unlp.edu.ar>

You need GNU make in order to compile mc.  Other implementation of make
don't work!  Run

gmake -f Makefile.xxx [RELEASE=1]

where gmake is name of GNU make and Makefile.xxx is the makefile for
your compiler.  You may want to add RELEASE=1 if you want to compile an
optimized version without debug information.

Following compilers are supported:

Makefile.VC4:  Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and above
Makefile.BC5:  Borland C++ 5.x
Makefile.RSX:  RSXNT (http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rainer/)
Makefile.MIN:  MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/)

Note that "supported" here means only that they used to work in the past
and the specific makefiles are provided for them!

Please note that the Win32 port is not actively developed.  The code may
be out-of-date.  You may need to fix the code in order to compile it.

If you add a file, don't forget to add it into Makefile.am, or it will
be missing from the release.  Note that the release procedure for GNU
Midnight Commander cannot detect missing files in the Win32 port!
