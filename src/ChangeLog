	* subshell.c: Set subshell_pid to 1 on startup

Fri Feb 13 19:59:39 1998  Alexander Savelyev <fano@VCom.kiev.ua>

	* screen.c: KEY_DC is also handled by delete_cmd.

	* vfs/ftpfs.c (chdir): sending the CWD command is not necessary
	(imho).

	(ftpfs_connection_close): Do not use WAIT_REPLY, closes
	connections faster. 

	(open_data_connection): implement the reget command. 
	
	* boxes.c: bigger VFS dialog box.

	* file.c (init_replace): Add support for copying files only if the
	size differs, and support for regetting ftp files.

Wed Feb 11 20:08:50 1998  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>

        * user.c (execute_menu_command): Extented the syntax of %-macros
        used in the user menu in order to switch quoting on (default) and
        off, e.g. %0f means don't quote the expanded macro, %f and %1f mean
        quote the expanded macro.


Fri Jan 30 16:43:47 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* dlg.c (create_dlg): Now we pass the flags parameter to the
	create_dialog routine. 

	* tkmain.c (xtoolkit_create_dialog): Check for the grided value

Fri Jan 23 07:28:54 1998  Peter Daum <gator@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* extfs.c (open_extfs_archive): Pass the filename to the list
	command.

	* extfs/mailfs: New file system for browsing mail files (support
	for compressed mail fiels as well).

Fri Jan 23 07:19:18 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel@absolute.spb.su>

        * edit/edit.h: mc_mkdir requires 2 arguments for any operation
        system. Obsolete #ifdef's removed.

        * edit/editwidget.c: ansi standard violation removed
	
        * nt/Makefile.NT: default SLang directory is now ../slang. Most
        of SLang sources are no more compiled for MC.

        * nt/drive.h: new file. Copied from os2/drive.h with minor changes

        * nt/ket.nt.c: new way for handling conflicting SHIFT_PRESSED
        definitions. get_event can work without blocking. Copy, move
        and delete operations work normally.

        * nt/slint.nt.c: SLang_getkey2 and Slang_input_pending2 are
        copied from src/slint.c

        * nt/sys/param.h: annoying warnings temporaly suppressed.

        * slang/slvideo.c, slang/slw32tty.c: new files. They contain
        changes by Alexander Dong.

        * src/myslang.h: definitions for acsii symbols removed, since
        they are available in slang.h. Double lines are not used anymore.

        * src/panelize.c: sys/wait.h is included only if HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H
        is defined

        * nt/Makefile.NT: text.c is added
        
	* nt/Makefile.VC4: "-debug" switch for linker is not used for
        release version

        * src/screen.c (show_dir): double lines are no more used by NT and
        OS/2 ports.
	
        * src/wtools.c (real_input_dialog_help): layout of input dialog for
        XView port is corrected

        * edit/edit.h: mc_mkdir requires 2 arguments for any operation
        system. Obsolete #ifdef's removed.

        * edit/editwidget.c: ansi standard violation removed

Wed Jan 21 14:01:29 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ext.c (regex_command): reverted the patch that changed tests for
	*p == ' ' || *p == '\t' to isspace().  isspace() is true for tabs,
	newlines, carriage-returns and vertical tabs as well.  Which is
	not what we want.

Wed Jan 21 11:58:39 1998  Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	* ftpfs.c (retrieve_dir): Avoid compiler warning by testing
	explicitly the value. 
	
        screen.c (format_file): color not initialized when we met
        empty_line.

Wed Jan 21 11:28:21 1998  Alex Tkachenko  <alex@bcs.zp.ua>

	* cmd.c, utilunix.c: cosmetic changes to reduce compiler warnings
	
	* utilunix.c (my_system): small fix for SCO zombies moved here;
	now it returns WEXITSTATUS(status) instead of status itself. While
	missing it may not hurt on i.e., linux, on SCO it gives incorrect
	value.
	
	* vfs/extfs.c system() calls replaced with my_system() call; this
	allows a greater degree of control - fixes SCO system() return value
	processing. Notice: plain replacement system() with WEXITSTATUS(system)
	does not produce correct behavior (don't ask me why).

	* panelize.c (do_external_panelize): similar fixes for pclose()
	return value on SCO.

	view.c (load_view_file): inverted value of viewer_magic_flag to
	put viewer decompression state in accordance with F8 label text.
	Also default_nroff_flag is initialized to be 1; thus enabling all
	filter processing by default easies mc usage for novice users.

Sun Jan 18 13:47:37 1998  Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	* main.c
	* panel.h, tkscreen.h : error when compile dlg.c
	* tkconf.h : paint_frame
	* screen.c : to include paint_frame
	* tkmain.c : I just copied clr_scr() from the text.c

Fri Jan 16 16:19:59 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* screen.c (format_file): Do not invoke the file_compute_color
	routine for empty lines. 

	* gmain.c: Color scheme for Gnome

	* gscreen.c: Color setup now allocated the GdkColor *.
	
	* color.c: Moved the default color setting to a per-port
	location (text.c for the text mode edition);  new color
	configuration: core;  Fixed the case where the color spec was
	buggy and we kept on a infinite loop; 

Fri Jan 16 13:47:13 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel@absolute.spb.su>
	
	* nt/drive.nt.c, nt/chmod.nt.c: Updated button_new and check_new
	calls

Fri Jan 16 12:47:39 1998  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>

        * vfs/ftpfs.c (command): Don't log passwords when the dialog between
        server and client is logged to a file (mc -l logfile).

        * vfs/ftpfs.c (resolve_symlink, retrieve_dir): When a directory
        contains spaces send two commands ("CWD path" and  "LIST .") instead of
        one command ("LIST path") in order to get directory listings.
