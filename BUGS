  216: If you drag a file into a directory that you don't have
       permissions to move the file to, gmc goes boom. (Not sure if
       this is the same bug as 216.)

  382: Steps to reproduce: Start editing a file label.
			   Drag as if to select part of the label
			   text.
			   gmc will fall over very soon afterwards.
			   (e.g. if you try to select the same icon
			   once or twice)
  707: Renaming files doesn't check for clashes

  1006: Try going to 'ftp://ftp.cs.cuc.edu/' and then clicking on the
        root window. I think the pointer grab stays around or
        something.

  The drop-non-existent-file-from-panel bug.

  The "try to view /etc/X11/XF86Config" bug.

  The "drag a file to desktop while holding down Ctrl" bug.
