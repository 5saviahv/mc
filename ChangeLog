Wed Apr 21 22:04:30 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	spec file.

1999-04-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (SHELL): Do not use grep -q, as it is not portable
	to every OS.

Thu Apr 15 21:59:52 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in: Linking from $srcdir/slang is broken when configure
	isn't called with an absolute path. Link from ../$srcdir/slang if
	configure was invoked with a relative path.

1999-03-20  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* configure.in: Do not rm the destination file and then link, use
	ln -sf. Link from $srcdir/slang, not from ../$srcdir/slang.

Tue Apr 13 06:07:05 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in: Some AC_ARG_WITH macros havn't checked $withval, i.e.
	--with-PACKAGE and --without-PACKAGE gave the same results.

1999-04-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (VERSION): Bumped version number to 4.5.30.

1999-03-30  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (VERSION): Bumped version number to 4.5.29.

Sun Mar 28 23:46:01 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

Fri Mar 26 19:16:38 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* */Makefie.*: fixed several missed conversions from libdir to
	mclibdir. (Should be automake'd, really)

1999-03-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Make.common.in: There were conflicting definitions of mclibdir
	(one for installation, one for source).  Now the source one is
	called mcsrclibdir.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Use mcsrclibdir where appropriate.

Mon Mar 22 03:00:15 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>
	
	* edit/syntax.c: Remove extra "|"  in "file ..\*\\.(pp|PP|pas|PAS|)$ \
	Pascal Program" (Heh, second time :)
	
	* Makefile.common: Until things gets clear, keep syntax rules in 
	$(prefix)/lib/mc//syntax, as this is how (LIBDIR "/syntax") expands.
	
	Also, $(libdir) changed to $(mclibdir), to avoid confusion with expanded
	@libdir@.

Mon Mar 22 01:52:32 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, Makefile.common: Add syntax/Makefile.in,
	as requested by Paul. Still, need some checking...

Sun Mar 21 03:55:24 1999 Paul Sheer <psheer@obsidian.co.za>

	* edit/*.[ch] gtkedit/*.[ch]: brought the editor up
	to date with cooledit 3.9.0. This adds some new features.
	Firstly the SYNTAX RULES ARE NO LONGER HARDCODED into
	syntax.c. This is because the rule set is becoming too
	large to maintain in its current form and because file
	loading is starting to get slow.

	There is also a bookmark feature which does not yet have
	key bindings assigned to it, but should be cool once
	these get inserted. Syntax rules files are named
	    $LIBDIR/cooledit/syntax/*.syntax

1999-03-20  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* configure.in: Create slang directory, it is needed when
	builddir != srcdir.
	Use -f when calling rm, the file does not exist on
	first compile.
	No need to copy VERSION from $srcdir, it's already generated in
	$buildir.

Fri Mar 19 06:32:36 1999  David Martin <dmartina@usa.net>

	radio buttons on first pass.

Fri Feb 26 21:45:30 1999  David Martin <dmartina@usa.net>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c: Mark strings in the search and replace
	dialogs for translation. Resized these dialogs to let the messages
	fit. 

1999-02-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtkedit/editwidget.c (selection_send): Use the proper type for
	64-bit cleanliness (Patch from George Lebl).

	0.99.98, too.

1999-02-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* new_icons/Makefile.in (ALLICONS): Added Tigert's new icons for
	PS and EPS files.  Thanks, Tigert!

1999-02-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (CCOPTS): Drop the prefix auto-detection.  

Wed Feb 10 02:48:51 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in: Add check, which, in case of system-installed SLang
	library tries to run a test program, which determines, does we need
	linking with libtermcap.a. Also, set of if's for finding terminfo
	dir changed to for cycle - a bit nicer :)

Tue Feb  9 20:52:19 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* README.QNX: Deleted documention about mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Tue Feb  9 20:46:07 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu.qnx.diff: Deleted, it was merged with mc.menu.

Tue Feb  9 20:32:39 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Removed GNU tar'isms (option z). Removed option -o 
	from tar calls when extracting (according to my man page this option 
	is only useful when creating archieves).

Tue Feb  9 20:28:15 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Applied patch from root 	<root@golia.dntis.ro> which 
	adds support for tar.bz2 and merges the support for freeze-compressed 
	tar files (tar.F) from mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Sun Feb  7 06:11:48 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* Makefile.in: Change calls to xmkdir to mkinstalldirs - this is more
	GNU-like :)

1999-01-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtkedit/gtkedit.c: Hack to get a string defined in a macro into
	the catalog file.

1999-02-02  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* new_icons/gnome-core.png: New icon for core files. Someone 
	please add the code part :)

Mon Feb  1 01:28:19 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

Fri Jan 29 22:55:56 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* slang/slang.h: renamed to slang-mc.h

	* slang/Makefile.in: delete slang.h on "make clean"

	* configure.in: link slang/slang-mc.h to slang/slang.h when the 
	included slang is used. Problem was that MC's slang.h was used
	when we compiled with an already installed SLang and the systems
	header file were included with <slang/slang.h>.
	Unfortunatly I can't use AC_LINK_FILES to make the links because
	if we needn't make any links AC_LINK_FILES makes a link from 
	srcdir to top_builddir (builddir != srcdir).

	Temporary add $LGPM to $LIBS when checking for the resizeterm
	and keyok functions (ncurses might be linked against GPM).

	Substitude PACKAGE (intl/Makefile makes use of it)

Wed Jan 27 03:34:44 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* gtkedit/edit.h: including of <malloc.h> and <stdlib.h> swaped by
	#include "global.h".

Sun Jan 17 03:19:47 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	path to include's search.

        * gtkedit/edit.c (edit_load_file): Off-by-one error disabled editing.

1999-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (REGEX_O): Always include regex.o as the code we
	are using in gmc is not using regcomp/regexec, but the internal
	Emacs API.  

	* src/regex.c: Do not compile the POSIX compatibility code, as we
	do not use it.

Tue Dec 29 15:49:45 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/Makefile.in (target install): install $(LIBFILES_OUT) from the 
	builddir

1998-12-08  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

        * new_icons/gnome-image-[lots].png: I added some icons for file
	types (image) there - someone please tell me what the correct
	location and naming convention is and I will try to follow that. :)

1998-12-08  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* configure.in (builddir): Add icons/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT so that
 	the build will still work.  (Has this been replaced by new_icons?)

	* doc/mc.1.in, mc.sgml: added my name to list ov authors

Thu Nov 26 12:20:06 1998  Pavel Roskin  <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* config.h.in: Removed from CVS, added to .cvsignore

	* acconfig.h, macros/curses.m4, src/xcurses.c, src/tty.h,
	configure.in:

	HAVE_SUNOS_CURSES and SUNOS_CURSES renamed to USE_SUNOS_CURSES
	HAS_CURSES added to acconfig.h

1998-11-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* autogen.sh: Add "-I macros" to the aclocal flags.

	* mc-aclocal.m4: Renamed fp_PROG_CC_STDC to MC_HPUX_PROG_CC_STDC
