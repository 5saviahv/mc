Wed Feb 10 02:48:51 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in: Add check, which, in case of system-installed SLang
	library tries to run a test program, which determines, does we need
	linking with libtermcap.a. Also, set of if's for finding terminfo
	dir changed do for cycle - a bit nicer :)

Tue Feb  9 20:52:19 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* README.QNX: Deleted documention about mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Tue Feb  9 20:46:07 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu.qnx.diff: Deleted, it was merged with mc.menu.

Tue Feb  9 20:32:39 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Removed GNU tar'isms (option z). Removed option -o 
	from tar calls when extracting (according to my man page this option 
	is only useful when creating archieves).

Tue Feb  9 20:28:15 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Applied patch from root 	<root@golia.dntis.ro> which 
	adds support for tar.bz2 and merges the support for freeze-compressed 
	tar files (tar.F) from mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Sun Feb  7 06:11:48 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* Makefile.in: Change calls to xmkdir to mkinstalldirs - this is more
	GNU-like :)

1999-01-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtkedit/gtkedit.c: Hack to get a string defined in a macro into
	the catalog file.

1999-02-02  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* new_icons/gnome-core.png: New icon for core files. Someone 
	please add the code part :)

Mon Feb  1 01:28:19 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in: Add check against setuid() and setreuid() functions.

Fri Jan 29 22:55:56 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* slang/slang.h: renamed to slang-mc.h

	* slang/Makefile.in: delete slang.h on "make clean"

	* configure.in: link slang/slang-mc.h to slang/slang.h when the 
	included slang is used. Problem was that MC's slang.h was used
	when we compiled with an already installed SLang and the systems
	header file were included with <slang/slang.h>.
	Unfortunatly I can't use AC_LINK_FILES to make the links because
	if we needn't make any links AC_LINK_FILES makes a link from 
	srcdir to top_builddir (builddir != srcdir).

	Temporary add $LGPM to $LIBS when checking for the resizeterm
	and keyok functions (ncurses might be linked against GPM).

	Substitude PACKAGE (intl/Makefile makes use of it)

Wed Jan 27 03:34:44 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* gtkedit/edit.h: including of <malloc.h> and <stdlib.h> swaped by

	path to include's search.

1999-01-10  Ilya Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>

        * gtkedit/edit.c (edit_load_file): Off-by-one error disabled editing.

1999-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (REGEX_O): Always include regex.o as the code we
	are using in gmc is not using regcomp/regexec, but the internal
	Emacs API.  

	* src/regex.c: Do not compile the POSIX compatibility code, as we
	do not use it.

	builddir

1998-12-08  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

        * new_icons/gnome-image-[lots].png: I added some icons for file
	types (image) there - someone please tell me what the correct
	location and naming convention is and I will try to follow that. :)

1998-12-08  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* configure.in (builddir): Add icons/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT so that

	* autogen.sh: Add "-I macros" to the aclocal flags.

	* mc-aclocal.m4: Renamed fp_PROG_CC_STDC to MC_HPUX_PROG_CC_STDC
