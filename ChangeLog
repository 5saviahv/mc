2001-02-07  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Only configure in vfs/samba if smbfs support is
	enabled even with Autoconf 2.13.

2001-01-30  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* macros/gnome-vfs.m4 (GNOME_WITH_VFS): Fix mishandling of
	--without-samba due to a typo.

	* configure.in: Only configure in vfs/samba if smbfs support is
	enabled. This optimization will only work with Autoconf-2.49c
	and above.

2001-01-13  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Don't create a faked malloc.h.
	* gtkedit/edit.h: Don't assume that malloc.h always exists.
	* src/mad.h: Likewise.

	* configure.in: Simplified handling of cons.saver.
	* src/Makefile.in: Likewise. Don't install cons.saver setuid.
	* mc.spec.in: Remove a workaround for the above.

	* configure.in: Use AC_CANONICAL_HOST - "target" is meaningless
	for MC. Don't rely on the output of uname - use $host_os.

2001-01-11  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Check for ext2 libraries only if VFS is enabled.

	* src/Makefile.in: Create directories before installing files.
	Removed all occurences of libprefix - it's never defined.

	* configure.in: All macros from configure.in moved to
	acinclude.m4. Added missing quotes in several places.
	* acinclude.m4: Likewise.

	* edit/Makefile.in: Don't install or uninstall mcedit -
	it cannot be installed before mc on systems without symlinks.
	* gtkedit/Makefile.in: Likewise.
	* src/Makefile.in: Install mcedit (if enabled) and mcview.
	Uninstall them.

	* macros/gnome-gettext.m4: Propagated change by Owen Taylor
	from acinclude.m4 in gtk+:
	Don't define ENABLE_NLS unless we have a working NLS.
	(This should keep libintl.h from being included when it doesn't
	exist).

2001-01-09  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* doc-gnome/C/figs/Makefile.am: New file.
	* doc-gnome/C/Makefile.am: Don't handle figs, let the new
	makefile do it.
	* configure: Substitute doc-gnome/C/figs/Makefile.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Distribute files listed in LOCALIZED_HELP.

2001-01-08  Szabolcs Ban <shooby@gnome.hu>

	* lib/mc.hlp.hu: Added Hungarian help file from

2000-10-23  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* mc.spec.in: Allow mcserv.8 to be gzipped.

	* doc-gnome/C/Makefile.am: Workaround for buggy db2html
	that cannot deal with "./gmc.sgml".

2000-10-09  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: GNOME_M4_FILES renamed to ACLOCAL_M4_SOURCES so
	that CVS Automake will drop dependencied to the macros that
	we don't distribute.

	* lib/mc.ext.in: Removed references to icons. Source RPMs
	grouped to one regex. Removed "Update" for source RPMs, added
	"Rebuild" instead. Added "Check signature" for all RPMs.
	Added a comment about pop-up menus in the text edition.

2000-10-06  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* gnome/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, vfs/Make-mc.in: Required
	flags moved out of CFLAGS as recommended by GNU coding
	standards.
	* configure.in: Don't add GLIB_CFLAGS to CFLAGS.
	* Make.common.in: XINC eliminated. GLIB_CFLAGS is now added to
	XCPPFLAGS.
	* INSTALL (Random notes on porting to other architectures):
	Completely rewritten. Recommended using CFLAGS instead of XINC.

2000-10-05  Pavel Machek  <pavel@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* lib/mc.ext.in: .spm is used by SuSE to mark src rpms

2000-10-04  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* gnome/*.desktop: Updated french strings.

2000-10-03  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* doc-gnome/C/gmc.sgml: DTD changed to "PNG Variant V1.1"
	to allow <legalnotice>. Unclosed tags fixed.

2000-09-30  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* mc.spec.in: New package mc-common. Use DESTDIR instead of
	misusing prefix. Don't install old icons - they don't exist.

	* lib/mc.sh.in: Use "rm -f" to delete temporary files. Use
	"export -f" to have mc() exported.
	* doc/mc.1.in: Changed description of the "-P" option to
	avoid inclusion of mc.sh and mc.csh into the manual.
	Corrected paths of mc.hlp, mc.no_proxy and ~/mc/Tree.

2000-09-24  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* doc/mc.1.in: Minor formatting fixes.

	* lib/mc.sh.in: Remove temporary file non-interactively.
	* doc/mc.1.in: updated example for mc.sh.

2000-09-23  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: mc.spec included to noinst_DATA so that "make all"
	updates it when needed.
	* mc.spec.in: Include translations with mc, not gmc. Run
	chkconfig --del in %preun, not %postun. --without-debug not
	needed. /etc/X11/wmconfig not needed. /etc/pam.d/mcserv shouldn't
	be executable. New files in %{prefix}/lib/mc/ - translated hints,
	editor files.

	* doc-gnome/C/Makefile.am: Fixed *clean targets. Use temporary
	directory for document processing. Comment changes. gmc.ps and
	gmc.pdf now generated from gmc.dvi.

	* configure: Always include Make.common as file, otherwise
	"make distclean" breaks.
	* edit/Makefile.in, gnome/Makefile.in, gtkedit/Makefile.in,
	slang/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, vfs/Make-mc.in: $(RMF)
	replaced with "rm -f" - the stangard says that "rm" is portable.
	Ditto $(MV). Adjusted *clean targets to match those in
	Automake. Removed "cross" target.

2000-09-22  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* doc/mc.sgml: Removed as obsoleted by doc/mc.in.1
	* doc/gnome.sgml: Removed as obsoleted by doc-gnome/C/gmc.sgml

	* doc/Makefile.am: ... this.

2000-09-21  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* lib/mc.sh.in: Use $HOME instead of '~' because the tilde
	is not expanded in all shells.
	* doc/mc.sgml: Updated the example script to reflect the above
	changes.
	* doc/mc.in.1: Likewise.

2000-09-19  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	Marco Ciampa

2000-09-18  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	edit/Makefile.in, gnome/Makefile.in, gtkedit/Makefile.in,
	slang/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, vfs/Make-mc.in: Replacing
	variable MKINSTALLDIRS and builddir with Automake-compatible
	mkinstalldirs and top_builddir.

	files. Added uninstall-local target.

2000-09-17  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: fixed wrong use of AC_MSG_RESULT inside
	AC_CACHE_VAL

	* Make.common.in: Added the "dvi" target for "make distcheck"
	to go further

	* doc-gnome/C/Makefile.am: ... this

2000-09-15  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Require autoconf 2.13 or above.
	Removed workarounds for older versions. Removed MCDEBUG
	variable - it's not used. --with-debug renamed to --with-mad and
	cleaned up. Always use -Wall with gcc, other manipulations with
	CFLAGS removed.

	* doc/Makefile.in, edit/Makefile.in, gnome/Makefile.in,
	gtkedit/Makefile.in, slang/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	vfs/Make-mc.in: preserve timestamp on "make distdir", otherwise
	mc.pot becomes out of date in the tarball.

2000-09-14  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Removed some abuses of CPPFLAGS. Removed useless
	tests for cp, mv and rm.
	* Make.common.in: Removed variables xv_bindir and STRIP.
	Variables CP, MV and RMF are assigned trivial values.

	* edit/Makefile.in: Don't link headers, add extra includes
	to CPPFLAGS instead. Put links to the build directory.
	Remove the hack with "mx" - it is not needed anymore.

	* configure.in: remove any manupulations with top_srcdir.
	Don't change CPPGLAGS when the internal editor is enabled,
	instead do it ...
	* edit/Makefile.in, gtkedit/Makefile.in: ... here

	* configure.in, Make.common.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	edit/Makefile.in, gnome/Makefile.in, gtkedit/Makefile.in,
	slang/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, vfs/Make-mc.in: rootdir
	changed to top_srcdir for Automake compatability

	* Makefile.am: aclocal should scan "." for gettext.m4

2000-08-28  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Make.common.in: removed hack for "make distcopy"
	* doc/Makefile.in, edit/Makefile.in, gnome/Makefile.in,
	gtkedit/Makefile.in, slang/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	vfs/Make-mc.in: added "distdir" target. Now "make dist" works
	for external builds.
	* edit/Makefile.in, slang/Makefile.in: added "Makefile" target

2000-08-24  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Make.common.in: support for "distdir" for compatability
	with Automake-generated makefiles
	* autogen.sh: run automake. Force cache - it is off by default
	in autoconf 2.49a, but it's still handy for maintainers
	* configure.in: adapted for Automake

	* AUTHORS: new file

2000-08-23  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: resurrect definition of xvers

	Ensured compatability with sgml2html, sgml2txt and sgml2latex
	* doc/mc.1.in: Typo fix

	* doc/mc.sgml: made compatible with sgml-tools 1.0.9
	* doc/linuxdoc-sgml.diff: removed
	* doc/Makefile.in: don't distribute linuxdoc-sgml.diff,
	distribute gnome.sgml

2000-08-15  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

2000-07-21  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* src/main.c: make 8bit input/output the default (99% of the people
	expects that; lets the remaining 1% use the configuration menu
	to disactivate it if they want)

2000-07-20  Andrew V. Samoilov  <sav@bcs.zp.ua>

2000-04-14  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* syntax/perl.syntax: According to Tomasz Wegrzanovski <maniek@beer.com>
	added 'and', 'or', 'not', 'for' keywords.

2000-04-06  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* syntax.c: Wery dirty fix to allow compilation of mcedit on ncurses
	based systems. Hope, this will make FreeBSD midc maintainer to enable

2000-02-23  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c (edit_replace_prompt): fix incorrect
	initialization of array of structure (gcc version 2.96 20000131
	chokes on it). 

	* lib/mc.hint: C-y and not C-u can be used to insert text in input
	lines (e. g. text which has been deleted with M-d).

	gnome-file-property-dialog.c, gpopup.c, gpopup2.c, gprefs.cgmain.h, 
	setup.c: Add option of using GNOME "magic" routines to determine file
	types. This makes MC intelligently look at the data in the file to see
	what type of file it is, rather than looking at the filename extension.
	This slows down MC quite a bit, so it has been made an optional
	preference item. Type detection is expected to improve as mime-magic
	matures.
	
2000-01-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* lib/mc.menu (shell_patterns): Add a missing "esac".  Thanks to
	Martin Bialasinski <martin@internet-treff.uni-koeln.de> for

	* configure.in: Added pt_BR to ALL_LINGUAS

1999-09-22  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.sh.in, mc.csh.in: renamed from mc.sh resp. mc.csh. Adapt
	path to the mc binary according to @prefix@.

	and zsh. Suggest to source mc.sh or mc.csh instead of adding verbatim
	copies of the included function definitions.

1999-09-20  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@redhat.com>

	* lib/startup.links: Changed the news link to Gnotices

1999-09-19  David Martin <dmartina@usa.net>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c (edit_print_string): Use unsigned char so that 
	8 bit chars from strftime get displayed when inserting date.

	* lib/mc.ext.in: Add entries for bzip2 compressed pages as used in 
	Mandrake 6.0. The generic entry for bzip2 moved to the end of the 
	file to avoid interferences. In this one I changed the extension check 
	to a type check (as used for gzip) which might give problems in some 
	systems.

	* configure.in: Use -Tlatin1 to format man pages when available and 
	"view" 8 bit chars.

1999-09-19  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

1999-09-16  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Remove the magicdev autoconf test in favor of just
	including the idl file. Otherwise we have a dependency
	loop between this and magicdev.

1999-09-08  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@redhat.com>

	* idl/FileManager.idl: Changed names, and put everything under a
	FileManager module.  Added a Desktop interface and some methods to
	the WindowFactory interface.

1999-09-08  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* doc-gnome/*: Shiny new docs from users-guide.

	updated).

1999-08-20  Norbert Warmuth <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in (AC_WITH_SLANG): rm -f destination before makeing
	a symbolic link (ln -sf doesn't work as expected on Solaris)

1999-08-19  Elliot Lee <sopwith@redhat.com>
	* */Makefile.in: Have 'make dist' work with builddir != srcdir.

1999-08-19  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@redhat.com>

	* gtkedit.c, edit.c, editcmd.c, syntax.c, edit.h, bookmark.c,
	editwidget.c: bring editor stuff up to date with cooledit 3.11.5
	This adds some new syntax rules, and spell check on the fly
	which if someone bugs me for, will actually get enabled in
	both the text and gnome versions. Bookmark stuff also needs
	some keys bound to it, I suppose: any takers?

July 19, 1999 Elliot Lee

Wed Apr 21 20:44:41 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in: New option --with-tm-x-support, use MCCFLAGS and

	spec file.

1999-04-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	to every OS.

Thu Apr 15 21:59:52 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in: Linking from $srcdir/slang is broken when configure
	isn't called with an absolute path. Link from ../$srcdir/slang if
	configure was invoked with a relative path.

1999-03-20  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* configure.in: Do not rm the destination file and then link, use

Tue Apr 13 06:07:05 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* configure.in: Some AC_ARG_WITH macros havn't checked $withval, i.e.
	--with-PACKAGE and --without-PACKAGE gave the same results.

1999-04-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

Fri Mar 26 19:16:38 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	mclibdir. (Should be automake'd, really)

1999-03-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Make.common.in: There were conflicting definitions of mclibdir
	(one for installation, one for source).  Now the source one is
	called mcsrclibdir.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Use mcsrclibdir where appropriate.

Mon Mar 22 03:00:15 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>
	
	* edit/syntax.c: Remove extra "|"  in "file ..\*\\.(pp|PP|pas|PAS|)$ \
	Pascal Program" (Heh, second time :)
	
	* Makefile.common: Until things gets clear, keep syntax rules in 
	$(prefix)/lib/mc//syntax, as this is how (LIBDIR "/syntax") expands.
	
	Also, $(libdir) changed to $(mclibdir), to avoid confusion with expanded
	@libdir@.

Mon Mar 22 01:52:32 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, Makefile.common: Add syntax/Makefile.in,
	as requested by Paul. Still, need some checking...

Sun Mar 21 03:55:24 1999 Paul Sheer <psheer@obsidian.co.za>

	* edit/*.[ch] gtkedit/*.[ch]: brought the editor up
	to date with cooledit 3.9.0. This adds some new features.
	Firstly the SYNTAX RULES ARE NO LONGER HARDCODED into
	syntax.c. This is because the rule set is becoming too
	large to maintain in its current form and because file
	loading is starting to get slow.

	There is also a bookmark feature which does not yet have
	key bindings assigned to it, but should be cool once
	these get inserted. Syntax rules files are named
	    $LIBDIR/cooledit/syntax/*.syntax

1999-03-20  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* configure.in: Create slang directory, it is needed when
	builddir != srcdir.
	Use -f when calling rm, the file does not exist on
	first compile.
	No need to copy VERSION from $srcdir, it's already generated in
	$buildir.

Fri Mar 19 06:32:36 1999  David Martin <dmartina@usa.net>

	* applied a patch from Duncan Mak <mustapha@wegythu.res.cmu.edu>
	to get the mc spec file to work.
	* hacked configure to generate a properly versioned spec file.

Fri Feb 26 22:06:51 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c (menu_save_mode_cmd): translate strings for
	radio buttons on first pass.

Fri Feb 26 21:45:30 1999  David Martin <dmartina@usa.net>

	* gtkedit/editcmd.c: Mark strings in the search and replace
	dialogs for translation. Resized these dialogs to let the messages
	fit. 

1999-02-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtkedit/editwidget.c (selection_send): Use the proper type for
	64-bit cleanliness (Patch from George Lebl).

	0.99.98, too.

1999-02-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* new_icons/Makefile.in (ALLICONS): Added Tigert's new icons for
	PS and EPS files.  Thanks, Tigert!

1999-02-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (CCOPTS): Drop the prefix auto-detection.  

Wed Feb 10 02:48:51 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* configure.in: Add check, which, in case of system-installed SLang
	library tries to run a test program, which determines, does we need
	linking with libtermcap.a. Also, set of if's for finding terminfo
	dir changed to for cycle - a bit nicer :)

Tue Feb  9 20:52:19 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* README.QNX: Deleted documention about mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Tue Feb  9 20:46:07 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu.qnx.diff: Deleted, it was merged with mc.menu.

Tue Feb  9 20:32:39 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Removed GNU tar'isms (option z). Removed option -o 
	from tar calls when extracting (according to my man page this option 
	is only useful when creating archieves).

Tue Feb  9 20:28:15 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/mc.menu: Applied patch from root 	<root@golia.dntis.ro> which 
	adds support for tar.bz2 and merges the support for freeze-compressed 
	tar files (tar.F) from mc.menu.qnx.diff.

Sun Feb  7 06:11:48 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* Makefile.in: Change calls to xmkdir to mkinstalldirs - this is more
	GNU-like :)

1999-01-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtkedit/gtkedit.c: Hack to get a string defined in a macro into
	the catalog file.

1999-02-02  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* new_icons/gnome-core.png: New icon for core files. Someone 
	please add the code part :)

Fri Jan 29 22:55:56 1999  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* slang/slang.h: renamed to slang-mc.h

	* slang/Makefile.in: delete slang.h on "make clean"

	* configure.in: link slang/slang-mc.h to slang/slang.h when the 
	included slang is used. Problem was that MC's slang.h was used
	when we compiled with an already installed SLang and the systems
	header file were included with <slang/slang.h>.
	Unfortunatly I can't use AC_LINK_FILES to make the links because
	if we needn't make any links AC_LINK_FILES makes a link from 
	srcdir to top_builddir (builddir != srcdir).

	Temporary add $LGPM to $LIBS when checking for the resizeterm
	and keyok functions (ncurses might be linked against GPM).

	Substitude PACKAGE (intl/Makefile makes use of it)

Wed Jan 27 03:34:44 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* gtkedit/edit.h: including of <malloc.h> and <stdlib.h> swaped by
	#include "global.h".

1999-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* configure.in (REGEX_O): Always include regex.o as the code we
	are using in gmc is not using regcomp/regexec, but the internal
	Emacs API.  

	* src/regex.c: Do not compile the POSIX compatibility code, as we
	do not use it.

Tue Dec 29 15:49:45 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* lib/Makefile.in (target install): install $(LIBFILES_OUT) from the 
	builddir

1998-12-08  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

        * new_icons/gnome-image-[lots].png: I added some icons for file
	types (image) there - someone please tell me what the correct
	location and naming convention is and I will try to follow that. :)

1998-12-08  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* configure.in (builddir): Add icons/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT so that
 	the build will still work.  (Has this been replaced by new_icons?)

	* doc/mc.1.in, mc.sgml: added my name to list ov authors

	HAVE_SUNOS_CURSES and SUNOS_CURSES renamed to USE_SUNOS_CURSES
	HAS_CURSES added to acconfig.h

	* autogen.sh: Add "-I macros" to the aclocal flags.

	* mc-aclocal.m4: Renamed fp_PROG_CC_STDC to MC_HPUX_PROG_CC_STDC
