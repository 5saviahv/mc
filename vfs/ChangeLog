Tue Aug 11 15:25:52 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel.roskin@ecsoft.co.uk>

	* extfs/rpm: Fix for buggy "cut" on HP-UX 10.20 which ignores
	lines without enf-of-line.

1998-08-07  Timur Bakeyev (timur@comtat.ru)

	* tar.c (read_header): Support for linkflag on BSDI tar (pax), it
	is always 0.

1998-06-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_open_socket): Potential security break fix.

1998-08-06  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Make it `make dist' friendly.
	Don't try building this, yet.

1998-07-31  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* Make-mc.in (install.extfs): Splitted install of $(EXTFS_CONST)
	and $(EXTFS_OUT) because the first must be installed from
	$(srcdir) and the second from $(builddir).

Fri Jul 24 00:22:30 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Make-mc.in (DISTVFS): Changed Makefile.in to Make-mc.in.

	* Makefile.am: New file.
	* Make-mc.in: Renamed from Makefile.in.
	* Makefile.in: Removed.

Mon Jun 29 15:12:55 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel.roskin@ecsoft.co.uk>

	* Makefile.in: Rewritten stuff concerning extfs files.

Mon Jun 22 22:30:00 1998  Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove arfs, since it doesn't seem to exist

Wed Jun 17 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	* Rename helper scripts (extfs/{rar|lha|...}.in), so their names
	are more logical (and so that things actually work, because new
	names are currently in extfs.ini). 
	
Wed Jun 17 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	* Modified code to use tempnam() instead of tmpnam(), fixed
	tempnam() to use NULL instead of 0. 

Wed Jun  3 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* libvfs.c: adding libvfs.c which should contain things specific
 	to stand-alone libvfs.so. (This file was missing from previous
 	merge.)
	
Mon Jun  1 16:00:19 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_fill_names): use right character to seperate
	prefix and username

Mon Jun  1 14:19:20 1998  Bakeyev I. Timur <timur@comtat.kazan.ru>
	* vfs.c (parse_ls_lga): allow a bit wider range of listings.

	* vfs.c (is_time, is_year): new functions

Mon Jun  1 12:47:50 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_forget): Use the new ftpfs prefix.

Thu May 28 16:42:31 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* extfs.c, shared.c, tar.c: I changed semantics in my previous
	patch - _get_path() now modifies strings passed to it. I thought
	that I were carefull enough not to introduce bugs. You guessed it -
	I was not. [Many tar_ and extfs_ functions modify strings passed 
	to them, but as they are only called from vfs layer, it does not 
	matter much.]
	So I renamed function to alert everyone that semantics changed. 

	Fixed bugs in timestamping (and segfaults) when you entered tar 
	inside zip file or similar.

	* vfs.c (mc_open): Die if the filesystem doesn't support open

???         Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	* shared.c: Shared parts of extfs.c and tar.c are now in shared.c

	* util-alone.*: VFS should be able to compile stand-alone into
 	libvfs.so usable by anyone. This is first step.

	* vfs.c & others: syntax change. We no longer use
 	tar:/path.tar/file. Now, syntax is /path.tar#utar/file, which has
 	better defined meaning. Similar changes are done to all other
 	protocols. This change touched really _many_ places of code.


1998-05-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c (MC_DIROP): Macro now returns the proper value. 

1998-maj-18  Tamasi Gyorgy (gt_cosy@usa.net)

	* Makefile.in ('install' target): 'mcserv' not installed, if
	net-code is not enabled by 'configure'.

Thu May 14 02:05:52 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* Makefile.in (LIBS): add @LINTL@

Sun May 10 14:51:03 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (__ftpfs_chdir): CWD command wasn't sent at all. This
	optimation is wrong because for directories containing spaces we
	have to "CWD <pathname>" and "LIST -la" instead of 
	"LIST -la <pathname>".
	I implemented a different optimation. Now ftpfs_chdir only stores
	the new working directory and sets a flag. __ftpfs_chdir is called 
	when we really want to change the directory on the ftp server. 

	(resolve_symlink): Log the directory listing to the logfile.

	* ftpfs.h (struct ftpfs_connection): Added a (per connection)
	cwd_defered flag.

Mon May  4 10:27:49 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* Makefile.in: Links to mad.c and mad.h were created wrong when
	srcdir != builddir and directory depth to srcdir and builddir were 
	different (e.g. srcdir=/src/mc and builddir=/src/compile/mc)

	* ftpfs.c (retrieve_file_start2): Don't create target file O_EXCL, 
	in copy_file_file we check existance of the target file and know
	that we want to truncate it.

1998-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* tar.c (read_header): Mark regular files with S_IFREG.

Tue Apr 28 06:06:03 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* extfs.c (extfs_open, extfs_close): Changed my_system(1,...) to
	my_system(EXECUTE_AS_SHELL,...), this fixes the broken copyin and
	copyout of 4.1.32.
	
1998-04-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ftpfs.c (retrieve_file_start2): Open file exclusively.
	(retrieve_file): likewise.

1998-03-31  Philippe De Muyter <phdm@macqel.be>

	* vfs.h: compilation fix for m68k-motorola-sysv

Wed Mar 25 19:01:48 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* extfs/hp48: Added a usage summary

Mon Mar 23 00:42:21 1998  Christofer Edvardsen <ce@earthling.net>

	* Makefile.in, extfs/extfs.ini, extfs/hp48: New external
	filesystem to view and copy files to/from the HP48.

Wed Feb 11 14:09:02 1998  Oleg <oleg@pobox.com>

	* extfs.c: Add support for writtable external file systems.
	Required for the httpfs. 

Fri Jan 23 07:27:37 1998  Peter Daum <gator@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* extfs.c (open_extfs_archive): Pass the quoted argument to the
	list command. 

	* mailfs: new file system.
	
1997-12-21  Yuri Kuzmenko <Yuri.Kuzmenko@f169.n463.z2.fidonet.org>

        * tar.c: fix the bug which core dumps when trying to view tar file
        with many files (over 60000).

Mon Jul 21 18:47:37 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c (mc_opendir): Do not make conversions between int/void *
	to make the code compile and work on the Alpha correctly.
	Allocate a pointer to an int and use that instead.

Thu Jul  3 19:08:43 1997  Michele Marziani <marziani@axpfe1.fe.infn.it>

	* extfs/rpm: Small fix for older RPM files.

Mon Jun  9 19:00:30 1997  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>
	
	* vfs/vfs.c (vfs_canon): Fix for the 'cd a:/somedir/..' problem

        * vfs/vfs.c (vfs_add_non_current_stamps): when leaving a mtools fs
        free the extfs buffers immediatly instead of waiting for the vfs-
        timeout

Thu May 29 14:50:41 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c (vfs_canon): the "local:" case was consuming one extra
	character.  This fixes the bug reported by Andrej.  Also, handle
	the non-canonical case of arguments to  local:

Tue May 27 20:38:28 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* mcserv.c (get_client): The parent now waits for the first forked
	process, getting rid of the zombies.

	* utilvfs.c (open_tcp_link): If we can not contact the remote
	portmapper, set the protocol version to 1.

Fri May 16 16:42:18 1997  Tomasz K³oczko, <kloczek@rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl>

	* mc.spec: New spec file, this packages mc, mcserv and tkmc.

	* lib/mcserv.init, lib/mc.sh, lib/mcserv.pamd: added
	
	* vfs/ext/rpm: instead using sed and rpm -qpi use rpm queries,
	more info currently displayed (changeslogs, Os, URL, packager 

Tue May 13 18:14:49 1997  Wojtek Pilorz <wpilorz@bdk.lublin.pl>

	* vfs/Makefile.in (INSTALL_PROGRAM): Use -m flag for install to
	force vfs scripts to be executable on those systems that use
	install.sh 

	* src/utilunix.c: Implement socketpair for SCO flavored systems.
	
Mon Mar 17 12:03:50 1997  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* configure.in (--with-hsc): fix.
	
        * vfs/ftpfs.c (ftpfs_get_proxy_host_and_port): Fixed wrong parameter
        passing (HSC_DEFAULT_PORT was passed as pointer to char instead of
        passing it as integer)
 
Tue Feb 25 20:21:00 1997  Joseph M. Hinkle <jhinkle@rockisland.com>

	* extfs/lha: Updated the lha filesystem and included a command
	for running an executable from within an lha archive suggested
	by Zdenek Kabelac <kabi@informatics.muni.cz>

	* extfs/: Renamed cpio, deb, rar, rpm as *.in files and altered
	config.in to create these VFS's for cleaner compilation
