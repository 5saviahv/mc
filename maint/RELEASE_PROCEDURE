This document describes step by step the release procedure of GNU
Midnight Commander.


Announce the intention to release the next version in both mailing lists
at least 3 days before the release date, unless it's a security release.

Make sure that all significant user-visible changes are in the NEWS
file.  Group changes by topics to improve readability.

Review the English version of the manual and fix it if necessary.

Check dates in all manuals and update them if significant changes have
been done since the previous release.

Make sure that maint/mctest covers most features of the current code and
run it on a clean working directory.

Review files with stdout and stderr from every build.  Make sure that
all warnings (if any) are caused by other software and cannot be avoided
without significant damage to the code.

Upload the resulting tarball and binary packages to login.ibiblio.org.

Change the homepage to mention the new version.

Announce the release in both mailing lists.
