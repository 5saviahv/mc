#
# Default metadata file provided by the GNOME File Manaeger.
#
# The following metadata keys are used by the File Manager:
#
# icon-filename:
#    Points to a full pathname that contains the icon that 
#    is bound to this file.
#
# icon-inline-png:
#    If present, the value of this entry is an inlined PNG image 
#    that should be used to display this file.
#
# drop-open:
#    Command to run when a file or files are dropped on this
#    file.  If value is not available, the file manager will try 
#    to use the contents of the 'open' key.
#
# open:
#    Command to execute when the file is "opened".  The same interpolation
#    done for "drop-open" is done with "open".
#
# Interpolation for open and drop-open:
#    Any ocurrence of the strings '%c'/%C '%f' are interpolated. 
#    with the drop site name (ie, the name of the file or executable where
#    data was dropped) and the file or files that were dropped there 
#    respectively.  The character "\" can be used to escape text.  
#  
# Execution is done without shell intervention, so no shell metacharacters
# are used.
