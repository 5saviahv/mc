	* gwidget.c (x_create_radio): Connect to the "toggled" signal to
	keep track of the radio button.

	* gwidget.c (x_update_input): This can be invoked before the
	widget X resources have been allocated.  Take care of this.

	(x_create_input): update the cursor position as well.

	* gmain.c (get_color): Make it use GdkColorContext correctly.

	* gscreen.c (panel_create_filter): The filter control is now a
	nice GnomeEntry.  It does not work due to gmc trapping key events;
	I'll look into it tomorrow.
	(internal_select_item): Fixed broken behavior.  Now uses GtkCList properly.
	default_filters: new structure with pre-defined glob patterns.
	This is actually broken, because it will only work when
	easy_patterns is enabled.  I have to figure a way to make it work
	with regexp mode as well.

Thu Mar  5 23:54:58 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gdesktop.c (drop_on_panel): New function;  Used by the directory
	icons and by regular panels to support drag targets;

	* gscreen.c (panel_drop_data_available): Performs the drop action
	on a panel.  It needs fixing, as the DropDataAvailabelEvent does
	not provide any information as to where the drop actually
	happened. 

	(fixed_gtk_widget_dnd_drag_set, fixed_gtk_widget_dnd_drop_set):
	Only set the main window of the clist to be the source/target of
	the drag and drop code.  The little square at the end did not make
	much sense as a drop/drag spot.
	
1998-03-04  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gmain.h: Added prototype for x_filter_changed().
	Added #include "panel.h".

	* gconf.h (PORT_HAS_FILTER_CHANGED): New flag for conditional compilation.

Wed Mar  4 22:43:00 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtools.c (query_dialog): Rewritten to use the MC dialog/widget code. 

	* gutil.c (my_system), acconfig.h: By default gnome will not have
	a subshell (at least for now) and will now exec everything
	asyncronously by default.

	* gscreen.c: Exactly what was I thinking when I used the
	g_panel_contents structure will remain a mistery for future
	programming psycologists.  It was a huge mistake.

	* gdesktop.c: Use the new icon/text display routine from
	Federico. 

Tue Mar  3 21:03:52 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gmain.c (x_destroy_dlg): Call gtk_grab_remove when destroying
	the dialog. 

	* gmain.c (x_focus_widget): Handle special case of toplevels.

1998-03-04  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gscreen.c: Some hackish changes to work around idempotence bugs
	in gtk_clist_select_row().
