	* gdesktop.c (drop_on_panel): New function;  Used by the directory
	icons and by regular panels to support drag targets;

	* gscreen.c (panel_drop_data_available): Performs the drop action
	on a panel.  It needs fixing, as the DropDataAvailabelEvent does
	not provide any information as to where the drop actually
	happened. 

	(fixed_gtk_widget_dnd_drag_set, fixed_gtk_widget_dnd_drop_set):
	Only set the main window of the clist to be the source/target of
	the drag and drop code.  The little square at the end did not make
	much sense as a drop/drag spot.

	* gtools.c (query_dialog): Rewritten to use the MC dialog/widget code. 

	* gutil.c (my_system), acconfig.h: By default gnome will not have
	a subshell (at least for now) and will now exec everything
	asyncronously by default.

	* gscreen.c: Exactly what was I thinking when I used the
	g_panel_contents structure will remain a mistery for future
	programming psycologists.  It was a huge mistake.

	* gdesktop.c: Use the new icon/text display routine from
	Federico.

	* gmain.c (x_destroy_dlg): Call gtk_grab_remove when destroying
	the dialog. 

	* gmain.c (x_focus_widget): Handle special case of toplevels.

	* gscreen.c: Some hackish changes to work around idempotence bugs
	in gtk_clist_select_row().
