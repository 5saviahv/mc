	* gtools.c (query_dialog): Rewritten to use the MC dialog/widget code. 

	* gutil.c (my_system), acconfig.h: By default gnome will not have
	a subshell (at least for now) and will now exec everything
	asyncronously by default.

	* gscreen.c: Exactly what was I thinking when I used the
	g_panel_contents structure will remain a mistery for future
	programming psycologists.  It was a huge mistake.

	* gdesktop.c: Use the new icon/text display routine from
	Federico.

	* gmain.c (x_destroy_dlg): Call gtk_grab_remove when destroying
	the dialog. 

	* gmain.c (x_focus_widget): Handle special case of toplevels.

	* gscreen.c: Some hackish changes to work around idempotence bugs
	in gtk_clist_select_row().
