Midnight commander testfarm
----------------------------

CAUTION: ALWAYS run the test under an unprivileged user
where no harm can be done!


1. Generic Setup:

* Check out the branch MC-testfarm
* Adapt config.sh to your needs (probably not necessary)
* Run ./update-repo to download the repo master (which the
  individual build workdirs are always copied from)
* Also re-run that script regularily to keep up-to-date

2. How the test-scripts work

* There are several scripts which test different branches
  in different option variants (defined in the $TEST variable
  within the scripts)
* By convention, there is one test script per branch, named
  "run-test-<branch>". Within these scripts, the tests to run
  (aka option variants) and an ID (used for subdir names) is
  defined. The actual dirty work is done by _run_test.sh
* The ./configure options for each variant reside under ./opt
* Output files are found under ./out/$ID/
* Different test scripts can be run parallel, but only one
  instance is allowed per individual script
* For each successfully variant an appropriate *.OK file
  is put into the ./out/$ID/ subdir.
* These *.OK files prevent that test to be rerun on next
  call of the test-script.
