	* python.syntax: Added chunk from Savannah bug #7872. This
	changes the color for """long strings""" from brown to green and
	adds embedded highlighting for escape sequences.
	* Syntax: Added a comment introducing the file format, based on
	the current implementation in edit/syntax.c. Changed the
	first-line regular expressions of sh, perl, python and ruby to
	also match @SH@, @PERL@, @PYTHON@ and @RUBY@.

	* Syntax: Extended the patterns for #! interpreters to match
	almost everything that looks like the interpreter.
