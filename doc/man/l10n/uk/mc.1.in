.\"NODE "Overview"
If specified, the first path name is the directory to show in the selected
panel; the second path name is the directory to be shown in the other panel.
.SH Overview
.\"LINK2"
.\"Menu Bar"
The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.  Almost all
of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels.  By default, the
second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the
bottom line shows the function key labels.  The topmost line is the menu bar
line\&.  The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the
topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Directory Panels"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Left and Right Menus"
.\"LINK2"
.\"File Menu"
The Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same
time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the
current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some
file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of the
unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they always ask you for
confirmation first). For more information, see the sections on the Directory
Panels\&, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu\&.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Shell Command Line"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Input Line Keys"
.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
You can execute system commands from the Midnight Commander by simply typing
them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line, and when
you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the command line you
typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sections to learn
more about the command line.
.SH "Mouse Support"
The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is activated whenever
you are running on an \fBxterm(1)\fP terminal (it even works if you take a
telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if
you are running on a Linux console and have the \fBgpm\fP mouse server running.
.PP
When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is
selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or
unmarked, depending on the previous state).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
Double\-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an
executable program; and if the extension file has a program specified for
the file's extension, the specified program is executed.
.PP
Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key
labels by clicking on them.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Save Setup"
The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This
may be changed to other values by editing the \&~/.config/mc/ini file and
changing the \fImouse_repeat_rate\fP parameter.
.PP
If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can
get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down
the Shift key.
.SH ""
.\"NODE "Keys"
.SH Keys
Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of the \fIControl\fP
(sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the \fIMeta\fP (sometimes labeled ALT or
even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbreviations:
.TP 
\fBC\-<chr>\fP
means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>.  Thus
C\-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-<chr>\fP
means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing <chr>.  If there is
no Meta or Alt key, type \fIESC\fP, release it, then type the character
<chr>.
.TP 
\fBS\-<chr>\fP
means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.
.PP
All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU
Emacs editor's key bindings (default).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Keys_redefine"
You may redefine key bindings. See \fIredefine hotkey bindings\fP
.PP
for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) relative to
default behavior.

.PP
There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the
most important.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"File Menu"
The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands
appearing in the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of
these commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the
tagged files.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Directory Panels"
The Directory Panels section documents the keys which select a file or tag
files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one from the
file menu).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Shell Command Line"
The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for entering and
editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and such from the
directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access
the command line history.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Input Line Keys"
Input Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the
command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.

.\"NODE "  Keys_redefine"
.SH "  Redefine hotkey bindings"
Hotkey bindings may be read from external file (keymap\-file).  A keymap\-file
is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):
.IP
.br
1) command line option \fB\-K \<keymap\>\fP or
\fB\-\-keymap=\<keymap\>\fP
.br
2) Environment variable \fBMC_KEYMAP\fP
.br
3) Parameter \fBkeymap\fP in section \fB[Midnight\-Commander]\fP of config file.
.br
4) File \fB~/.local/share/mc/mc.keymap\fP
.br
5) File \fB@sysconfdir@/mc/mc.keymap\fP
.br
6) File \fB@prefix@/share/mc/mc.keymap\fP
.PP
Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may
contain the absolute path to the keymap\-file (with the extension .keymap or
without it). Search of keymap\-file will occur in (to the first one found):
.IP
.br
1)  \fB~/.local/share/mc\fP
.br
2)  \fB@sysconfdir@/mc/\fP
.br
3)  \fB@prefix@/share/mc/\fP

.\"NODE "  Miscellaneous Keys"
.SH "  Miscellaneous Keys"
Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:
.TP 
\fBEnter\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the
panels), then that command is executed. If there is no text in the command
line then if the selection bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander
does a \fBchdir(2)\fP to the selected directory and reloads the information on
the panel; if the selection is an executable file then it is
executed. Finally, if the extension of the selected file name matches one of
the extensions in the extensions file then the corresponding command is
executed.
.TP 
\fBC\-l\fP
repaint all the information in the Midnight Commander.
.TP 
\fBC\-x c\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Chmod"
run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged files.
.TP

.\"LINK2"
.\"Find File"
executes the Find file command.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-c\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Quick cd"
pops up the quick cd dialog.
.TP 
\fBC\-o\fP
when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an
xterm, it will show you the output of the previous command.  When ran on the
Linux console, the Midnight Commander uses an external program (cons.saver)
to handle saving and restoring of information on the screen.
.PP
.\"NODE "  Directory Panels"
When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C\-o at any time and
you will be taken back to the Midnight Commander main screen, to return to
your application just type C\-o.  If you have an application suspended by
using this trick, you won't be able to execute other programs from the
Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended application.
.SH "  Directory Panels"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Left and Right Menus"
This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you
want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a look at the
section on Left and Right Menus\&.
.TP 
\fBTab, C\-i\fP
change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new current panel
and the old current panel becomes the new other panel. The selection bar
moves from the old current panel to the new current panel.
.TP 
\fBInsert, C\-t\fP
to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence).  To
untag files, just retag a tagged file.
.TP 
\fBM\-e\fP
to change charset of panel you may use M\-e (Alt\-e).  Recoding is made from
selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may
select "directory up" (..) in active panel.  To cancel the charsets in all
directories, select "No translation " in the dialog of encodings.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-g, Alt\-r, Alt\-j\fP
used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one,
respectively.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-t\fP

With this it is possible to quickly switch to brief listing, long listing,
user defined listing mode, and back to the default.
.TP 
\fBC\-\e (control\-backslash)\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Hotlist"
show the directory hotlist and change to the selected directory.
.TP 
\fB+ \ (plus)\fP
this is used to select (tag) a group of files.  The Midnight Commander will
prompt for a selection options. When \fIFiles only\fP checkbox is on, only
files will be selected.  If \fIFiles only\fP is off, as files as directories
will be selected.  When \fIShell Patterns\fP checkbox is on, the regular
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for
zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If \fIShell
Patterns\fP is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
expressions (see ed (1)). When \fICase sensitive\fP checkbox is on, the
selection will be case sensitive characters.  If \fICase sensitive\fP is off,
the case will be ignored.
.TP 
\fB\e (backslash)\fP
use the "\e" key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the
Plus key.
.TP

.TP 
\fBAlt\-o\fP
If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the
other panel and moves the selection to the next file. If the currently
selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other
panel and moves the selection to the next file.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-i\fP
make the current directory of the current panel also the current directory
of the other panel.  Put the other panel to the listing mode if needed.  If
the current panel is panelized, the other panel doesn't become panelized.
.TP 
\fBC\-PageUp, C\-PageDown\fP
only when supported by the terminal: change to ".." and to the currently
selected directory respectively.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-y\fP
moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the
\fI<\fP with the mouse.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-u\fP
moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the
\fI>\fP with the mouse.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-Shift\-h, Alt\-H\fP
.\"NODE "  Quick search"
displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v' with the
mouse.
.SH "  Quick search"
The Quick search mode allows to perform fast file search in file panel.
Press \fIC\-s\fP or \fIAlt\-s\fP to start a filename search in the directory
listing.
.P
When the search is active, the user input will be added to the search string
instead of the command line. If the \fIShow mini\-status\fP option is enabled
the search string is shown on the mini\-status line. When typing, the
selection bar will move to the next file starting with the typed
letters. The \fIBackspace\fP or \fIDEL\fP keys can be used to correct typing
mistakes. If C\-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.
.P
If quick search is started with double pressing of C\-s, the previous quick
search pattern will be used for current search.
.P
.\"NODE "  Shell Command Line"
Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters '*'
and '?'.
.SH "  Shell Command Line"
This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when
entering shell commands.

last entry, Alt\-n takes you to the next one.
.TP 
\fBAlt\-h\fP
.\"NODE "  General Movement Keys"
displays the history for the current input line.
.SH "  General Movement Keys"
The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common code to
handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each of them
also accepts some keys of its own.
.PP
Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some of the same movement keys, so
this section may be of use for those parts too.
.TP

.\"NODE "Menu Bar"
.SH "Menu Bar"
The menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top row of
the screen. The menu bar has five menus: "Left", "File", "Command",
"Options" and "Right".
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Left and Right Menus"
The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of the left and
right directory panels.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"File Menu"
The File Menu lists the actions you can perform on the currently selected
file or the tagged files.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Command Menu"
The Command Menu lists the actions which are more general and bear no
relation to the currently selected file or the tagged files.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Options Menu"
.\"NODE "  Left and Right Menus"
The Options Menu lists the actions which allow you to customize the Midnight
Commander.
.SH "  Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Layout"
.\"NODE "    Listing Mode..."
The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the \fBLeft\fP and
\fBRight\fP menus (they are named \fBAbove\fP and \fBBelow\fP when the horizontal
panel split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).
.SH "    Listing Mode..."
The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are four
different listing modes available: \fBFull\fP, \fBBrief\fP, \fBLong\fP and \fBUser\fP.
The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the
modification time.
.PP
The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns (therefore
showing twice as many files as other views). The long view is similar to the
output of \fBls \-l\fP command. The long view takes the whole screen width.
.PP
If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the
display format.
.PP
The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may be
"half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a full screen
panel respectively.
.PP
After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the panel,
this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format string.
.PP
After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier.
This are the available fields you may display:
.TP 
\fBname\fP
displays the file name.
.TP 
\fBsize\fP
displays the file size.
.TP 
\fBbsize\fP
is an alternative form of the \fBsize\fP format. It displays the size of the
files and for directories it just shows SUB\-DIR or UP\-\-DIR.
.TP 
\fBtype\fP
displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to what
is displayed by ls with the \-F flag \- \fB*\fP for executable files, \fB/\fP for
directories, \fB@\fP for links, \fB=\fP for sockets, \fB\-\fP for character devices,
\fB+\fP for block devices, \fB|\fP for pipes, \fB~\fP for symbolic links to
directories and \fB!\fP for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).
.TP 
\fBmark\fP
an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.
.TP 
\fBmtime\fP
file's last modification time.
.TP 
\fBatime\fP
file's last access time.
.TP 
\fBctime\fP
file's status change time.
.TP 
\fBperm\fP

\fBowner\fP
the owner of the file.
.TP 
\fBgroup\fP
the group of the file.
.TP 
\fBinode\fP

.PP
Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:
.TP 
\fBspace\fP
a space in the display format.
.TP 
\fB|\fP
add a vertical line to the display format.
.PP
To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add \fB:\fP
followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the
number is followed by the symbol \fB+\fP, then the size specifies the minimal
field size \- if the program finds out that there is more space on the
screen, it will then expand that field.
.PP
For example, the \fBFull\fP display corresponds to this format:
.PP
half type name | size | mtime
.PP
And the \fBLong\fP display corresponds to this format:
.PP
full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space
name
.PP
This is a nice user display format:
.PP
half name | size:7 | type mode:3
.PP
Panels may also be set to the following modes:
.TP 
\fBInfo\fP
The info view display information related to the currently selected file and
if possible information about the current file system.
.TP 
\fBTree\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Directory Tree"
The tree view is quite similar to the directory tree feature. See the
section about it for more information.
.TP 
\fBQuick View\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Internal File Viewer"
.\"NODE "    Sort Order..."
In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewer that displays the
contents of the currently selected file, if you select the panel (with the
tab key or the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer commands.
.SH "    Sort Order..."
The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time, by
access time, and by inode information modification time, by size, by inode
and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the sort order
and you may also specify if you want to sort in reverse order by checking
the reverse box.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Panel options"
.\"NODE "    Filter..."
By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed from
the Panel options menu (option \fBMix all files\fP).
.SH "    Filter..."
.\"NODE "    Reread"
The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example
\fB*.tar.gz\fP)  which the files must match to be shown. Regardless of the
filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories are always
shown in the directory panel.
.SH "    Reread"
.\"LINK2"
.\"External panelize"
.\"NODE "  File Menu"
The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is useful
if other processes have created or removed files.  If you have panelized
file names in a panel this will reload the directory contents and remove the
panelized information (See the section External panelize for more
information).
.SH "  File Menu"
The Midnight Commander uses the F1 \- F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for
commands appearing in the file menu.  The escape sequences for the function
keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals without
function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by pressing the
ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0 (corresponding to
F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).
.PP
The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in
parentheses):
.PP
\fBHelp (F1)\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Contents"
Invokes the built\-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help viewer\&, you
can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to follow that
link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move forward and backward in
a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted keys.
.PP
\fBMenu (F2)\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Menu File Edit"
Invoke the user menu\&.  The user menu provides an easy way to provide users
with a menu and add extra features to the Midnight Commander.
.PP
\fBView (F3, F13)\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Internal File Viewer"
View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the Internal File
Viewer but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an external
file viewer specified by the \fBVIEWER\fP environment variable.  If \fBVIEWER\fP
is undefined, the \fBPAGER\fP environment variable is tried.  If \fBPAGER\fP is
also undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use F13 instead, the
viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or preprocessing to the
file.
.PP
\fBFiltered View (Alt\-!)\fP
.PP
This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults
to the currently selected file name), the output from such command is shown
in the internal file viewer.
.PP
\fBEdit (F4, F14)\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Internal File Editor"
Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14)  to start
the editor with a new, empty file.  Currently they invoke the \fBvi\fP editor,
or the editor specified in the \fBEDITOR\fP environment variable, or the
Internal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.
.PP
\fBCopy (F5, F15)\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Mask Copy/Rename"
Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination
defaults to the directory in the non\-selected panel. During this process,
you can press C\-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details about source
mask (which will be usually either * or ^\e(.*\e)$ depending on setting of
Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see Mask
copy/rename\&.
.PP
F15 (usually F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected
panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged
files.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Background jobs"
On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking
on the background button (or pressing Alt\-b in the dialog box).  The
Background Jobs is used to control the background process.
.PP
\fBLink (C\-x l)\fP
.PP
Create a hard link to the current file.
.PP
\fBAbsolute symlink (C\-x s)\fP
.PP
Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.
.PP
\fBRelative symLink (C\-x v)\fP
.PP
Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.
.PP
To those of you who don't know what links are: creating a link to a file is
a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and the
destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit
one of these files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some
people call links aliases or shortcuts.
.PP
A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of
telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete
either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to
notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you
don't even want to know.
.PP
A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the
original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to
notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight Commander shows
an "@"\-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to somewhere
(except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).  The original file which
the link points to is shown on mini\-status line if the \fIShow mini\-status\fP
option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion
that can be caused by hard links.
.PP
When you press "C\-x s" Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the
complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for the
link.  You can change either one.
.PP
Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a
relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory:
.PP
\fI/home/frodo/mc/mc \-> /home/frodo/new/mc\fP
.PP
A relative link describes the original file's location starting from the
location of the link itself:
.PP
\fI/home/frodo/mc/mc \-> ../new/mc\fP
.PP
You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing "C\-x
v" instead of "C\-x s".
.PP
\fBRename/Move (F6, F16)\fP
.PP
Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination
defaults to the directory in the non\-selected panel. For more details look
at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.
.PP
F16 (usually F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected
panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged
files.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Background jobs"
On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking
on the background button (or pressing Alt\-b in the dialog box).  The
Background Jobs is used to control the background process.
.PP
\fBMkdir (F7)\fP
.PP
Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.
.PP
\fBDelete (F8)\fP
.PP
Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the currently
selected panel. During the process, you can press C\-c or ESC to abort the
operation.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Quick cd"
\fBQuick cd (Alt\-c)\fP Use the quick cd command if you have full command line
and want to cd somewhere.
.PP
\fBSelect group (+)\fP
.PP
This is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander will
prompt for a selection options. When \fIFiles only\fP checkbox is on, only
files will be selected.  If \fIFiles only\fP is off, as files as directories
will be selected.  When \fIShell Patterns\fP checkbox is on, the regular
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for
zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If \fIShell
Patterns\fP is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
expressions (see ed (1)). When \fICase sensitive\fP checkbox is on, the
selection will be case sensitive characters.  If \fICase sensitive\fP is off,
the case will be ignored.
.PP
\fBUnselect group (\e)\fP
.PP
Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the \fISelect
group\fP command.
.PP
\fBQuit (F10, Shift\-F10)\fP
.PP
.\"NODE "    Quick cd"
Terminate the Midnight Commander.  Shift\-F10 is used when you want to quit
and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift\-F10 will not take you to the
last directory you visited with the Midnight Commander, instead it will stay
at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.
.SH "    Quick cd"
.\"LINK2"
.\"The cd internal command"
.\"LINK2"
.\"The cd internal command"
.\"NODE "  Command Menu"
This command is useful if you have a full command line and want to cd
somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This command
pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter after
\fBcd\fP on the command line and then you press enter. This features all the
things that are already in the internal cd command\&.
.SH "  Command Menu"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Directory Tree"
The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Find File"
The "Find file" command allows you to search for a specific file.
.PP
The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.
.PP
The "Switch panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell
command.  This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.
.PP
The "Compare directories" command compares the directory panels with each
other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make the panels
identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method compares only
file size and file date. The thorough method makes a full byte\-by\-byte
compare. The thorough method is not available if the machine does not
support the mmap(2) system call.  The size\-only compare method just compares
the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date times, it just
checks the file size.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"External panelize"
The "External panelize" allows you to execute an external program, and make
the output of that program the contents of the current panel.
.PP
The "Command history" command shows a list of typed commands. The selected
command is copied to the command line. The command history can also be
accessed by typing Alt\-p or Alt\-n.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Hotlist"
The "Directory hotlist" command makes changing of the current directory to
often used directories faster.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Screen selector"
The "Screen list" command shows a dialog window with the list of currently
running internal editors, viewers and other MC modules that support this
mode.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
The "Edit extension file" command allows you to specify programs to executed
when you try to execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on files
with certain extensions (filename endings).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Menu File Edit"
.\"NODE "    Directory Tree"
The "Edit menu file" command may be used for editing the user menu (which
appears by pressing F2).
.SH "    Directory Tree"
The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You can
select a directory from the figure and the Midnight Commander will change to
that directory.
.PP
There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is
available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view from the
Left or Right menu.
.PP
To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by
scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the directory which
you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press C\-r (or
F2).
.PP
You can use the following keys:
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"General Movement Keys"
General movement keys are accepted.
.PP
\fBEnter.\fP In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to
this directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this
directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current
panel.
.PP
\fBC\-r, F2 (Rescan).\fP Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is
out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which
don't exist any more.
.PP
\fBF3 (Forget).\fP Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to
remove clutter from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree
figure press F2 in its parent directory.
.PP
\fBF4 (Static/Dynamic).\fP Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default)
and the static navigation mode.
.PP
In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a
directory. All known directories are shown.
.PP
In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a
sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent directory, and the
Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and
children directories are shown, others are left out. The tree figure changes
dynamically as you traverse.
.PP
\fBF5 (Copy).\fP Copy the directory.
.PP
\fBF6 (RenMov).\fP Move the directory.
.PP
\fBF7 (Mkdir).\fP Make a new directory below this directory.
.PP
\fBF8 (Delete).\fP Delete this directory from the file system.
.PP
\fBC\-s, Alt\-s.\fP Search the next directory matching the search string. If
there is no such directory these keys will move one line down.
.PP
\fBC\-h, Backspace.\fP Delete the last character of the search string.
.PP
\fBAny other character.\fP Add the character to the search string and move to
the next directory which starts with these characters. In the tree view you
must first activate the search mode by pressing C\-s. The search string is
shown in the mini status line.
.PP
The following actions are available only in the directory tree. They aren't
supported in the tree view.
.PP
\fBF1 (Help).\fP Invoke the help viewer and show this section.
.PP
\fBEsc, F10.\fP Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Mouse Support"
.\"NODE "    Find File"
The mouse is supported. A double\-click behaves like Enter. See also the
section on mouse support\&.
.SH "    Find File"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Directory Tree"
The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search and
the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree button you can select
the start directory from the directory tree figure.
.PP
.\"Whole words\" allows select only those files containing matches that
Option form whole words. Like grep \-w.
.PP
You can start the search by pressing the OK button.  During the search you
can stop from the Stop button and continue from the Start button.
.PP
You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir
button will change to the directory of the currently selected file. The
Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit button
quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found files
to the current directory panel so that you can do additional operations on
them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). After panelizing you can press
C\-r to return to the normal file listing.
.PP
The 'Enable ignore directories' checkbox and input field below it allow to
set up the list of directories that should be skip during the search files
(for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD\-ROM or on a NFS
directory that is mounted across a slow link). List components must be
separated with a colon, here is an example:
.PP
.nf
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs
.fi
.PP
Relative paths are supported also. The following example shows how to skip
special directories of version control systems:
.nf
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS
.fi
.PP
Attention: input field can contain a dot (.), this means the current
absolute path.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"External panelize"
.\"NODE "    External panelize"
You may consider using the External panelize command for some
operations. Find file command is for simple queries only, while using
External panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.
.SH "    External panelize"
The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make
the output of that program the contents of the current panel.
.PP
For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the symbolic
links in the current directory, you can use external panelization to run the
following command:
.PP
.nf
find . \-type l \-print
.fi
.PP
Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no longer
be the directory listing of the current directory, but all the files that
are symbolic links.
.PP
If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from your
FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file name from the
transfer log files:
.PP
.nf
awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /var/log/xferlog
.fi
.PP
.\"NODE "    Hotlist"
You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name,
so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on
the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under
which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that
command from the list and do not have to type it again.
.SH "    Hotlist"
The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories in the
directory hotlist.  The Midnight Commander will change to the directory
corresponding to the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog, you can
remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones.  To add new
directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command (C\-x h), which
adds the current directory into the directory hotlist, asking just for the
label for the directory.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"The cd internal command"
.\"NODE "    Extension File Edit"
This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the
CDPATH variable as described in internal cd command description.
.SH "    Extension File Edit"
This will invoke your editor on the file \fI~/.local/share/mc/mc.ext\fP.  The
format of this file following:
.PP
All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.
.PP
Lines starting in the first column should have following format:
.PP
\fIkeyword/expr\fP, i.e. everything after the slash until new line is \fIexpr\fP.
.PP
\fIkeyword\fP can be:
.TP 
\fIshell\fP
\- \fIexpr\fP is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name ends
with \fIexpr\fP.  Example: \fIshell/.tar\fP matches \fI*.tar\fP.
.TP 
\fIregex\fP
\- \fIexpr\fP is a regular expression.  File matches if its name matches the
regular expression.
.TP 
\fIdirectory\fP
\- \fIexpr\fP is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a directory and
its name matches the regular expression.
.TP 
\fItype\fP
\- \fIexpr\fP is a regular expression.  File matches if the output of \fIfile %f\fP
without the initial "filename:" part matches regular expression \fIexpr\fP.
.TP 
\fIdefault\fP
\- matches any file.  \fIexpr\fP is ignored.
.TP 
\fIinclude\fP
\- denotes a common section.  \fIexpr\fP is the name of the section.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Macro Substitution"
Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format:
\fIkeyword=command\fP (with no spaces around =), where \fIkeyword\fP should be:
\fIOpen\fP (invoked on Enter or double click), \fIView\fP (F3), \fIEdit\fP (F4) or
\fIInclude\fP (to add rules from the common section).  \fIcommand\fP is any
one\-line shell command, with the simple macro substitution\&.
.PP
.\"NODE "    Background jobs"
Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important.  If the
appropriate action is missing, search continues as if this rule didn't match
(i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and View action is
missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View action from the
second entry will be used).  \fIdefault\fP should match all the actions.
.SH "    Background Jobs"
.\"NODE "    Menu File Edit"
This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander process
(only copy and move files operations can be done in the background).  You
can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.
.SH "    Menu File Edit"
The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the
user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the current
directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and
is not world\-writable.  If no such file found, ~/.local/share/mc/menu is
tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system\-wide menu
@prefix@/share/mc/mc.menu.
.PP
The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with anything
but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to
use it like a hot key, the first character should be a letter). All the
lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be
executed when the entry is selected.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Macro Substitution"
When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied to
a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that
file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the
menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing the menu
code. For more information, see macro substitution\&.
.PP
Here is a sample mc.menu file:
.PP
.nf
A	Dump the currently selected file
	od \-c %f

B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:\-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1

	mail \-s "Midnight Commander bug" root < $I
	rm \-f $I

M	Read mail
	emacs \-f rmail

N	Read Usenet news
	emacs \-f gnus

H	Call the info hypertext browser
	info

J	Copy current directory to other panel recursively
	tar cf \- . | (cd %D && tar xvpf \-)

K	Make a release of the current subdirectory
	echo \-n "Name of distribution file: "

.PP
\fBDefault Conditions\fP
.PP
Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start
from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is true, the
menu entry will be the default entry.
.PP
.nf
Condition syntax: 	= <sub\-cond>
  or:			= <sub\-cond> | <sub\-cond> ...
  or:			= <sub\-cond> & <sub\-cond> ...

Sub\-condition is one of following:

  y <pattern>		syntax of current file matching pattern?
			(for edit menu only)
  f <pattern>		current file matching pattern?
  F <pattern>		other file matching pattern?
  d <pattern>		current directory matching pattern?
  D <pattern>		other directory matching pattern?
  t <type>		current file of type?
  T <type>		other file of type?
  x <filename>		is it executable filename?
  ! <sub\-cond>		negate the result of sub\-condition
.fi
.PP
Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the
shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the shell
patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first line of the menu
file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).
.PP
Type is one or more of the following characters:
.PP
.nf
  n	not a directory
  r	regular file
  d	directory
  l	link
  c	character device
  b	block device
  f	FIFO (pipe)
  s	socket
  x	executable file
  t	tagged
.fi
.PP
For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type is a
little special because it acts on the panel instead of the file. The
condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the current panel and
false if not.
.PP
If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be shown
whenever the value of the condition is calculated.
.PP
The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
.nf
	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
.fi
is calculated as
.nf
	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)
.fi
.PP
Here is a sample of the use of conditions:
.PP
.nf
= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
L	List the contents of a compressed tar\-archive
	gzip \-cd %f | tar xvf \-
.fi
.PP
\fBAddition Conditions\fP
.PP
If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it is an
addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will be included
in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not be included
in the menu.
.PP
You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition with
\&'+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you want to use
two different conditions, one for adding and another for defaulting, you can
precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with '+' and
another starting with '='.
.PP

.\"Save Setup"
.\"NODE "    Configuration"
The Save setup command saves the current settings of the Left, Right and
Options menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.
.SH "    Configuration"
The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "File operation
options", "Esc key mode", "Pause after run" and "Other options".
.PP
\fBFile operation options\fP
.PP
\fIVerbose operation.\fP This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete
operations are verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If
you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It
is automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than 9600
bps.
.PP
\fICompute totals.\fP If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander
computes total byte sizes and total number of files prior to any Copy,
Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accurate
progress bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if
\fIVerbose operation\fP is disabled.
.PP
\fIClassic progressbar.\fP If this option is enabled, the progressbar of
Copy/Move/Delete operations is always grown form left to right. If disabled,
the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of
Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left panel to right one and vice
versa. Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIMkdir autoname\fP When you press F7 to create a new directory, the input
line in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or directory in
active panel.  Disabled by default.
.PP
\fBEsc key mode.\fP
.PP
By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix.
Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is a
possibility to use a single press of ESC key for that action.
.PP
\fISingle press.\fP By default this option is disabled. If you'll enable it,
the ESC key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see
\fITimeout\fP option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC
key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).
.PP
\fITimeout.\fP This options is used to setup the time interval (in
microseconds)  for single press of ESC key. By default, this inrerval is one
second (1000000 microseconds). Also the timeout can be set via
KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable (also in microseconds), which
has higher priority than Timeout option value.
.PP
\fBPause after run\fP
.PP
After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander can pause, so that you
can examine the output of the command.  There are three possible settings
for this variable:
.PP
\fINever\fP.  Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If
you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to
see the output of the command by typing C\-o.
.PP
\fIOn\fPdumb\fIterminals\fP.  You will get the pause message on terminals that are
not capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal
that is not an xterm or the Linux console).
.PP
\fIAlways\fP.  The program will pause after executing all of your commands.
.PP
\fBOther options\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Internal File Editor"
\fIUse internal editor.\fP If this option is enabled, the built\-in file editor
is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in
the \fBEDITOR\fP environment variable is used.  If no editor is specified,
\fBvi\fP is used.  See the section on the internal file editor\&.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Internal File Viewer"
\fIUse internal viewer.\fP If this option is enabled, the built\-in file viewer
is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the
\fBPAGER\fP environment variable is used.  If no pager is specified, the
\fBview\fP command is used.  See the section on the internal file viewer\&.
.PP
\fIAuto menus.\fP If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at
startup.  Useful for building menus for non\-unixers.
.PP
\fIDrop down menus.\fP When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be
activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get the
menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with the arrow
keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.
.PP
\fIShell Patterns.\fP By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will
use shell\-like regular expressions. The following conversions are performed
to achieve this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the
\&'?' is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal
dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones
described in ed(1).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Completion"
\fIComplete: show all.\fP By default the Midnight Commander pops up all
possible completions if the completion is ambiguous only when you press
\fBAlt\-Tab\fP for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as
much as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if
you want to see all possible completions even after pressing \fBAlt\-Tab\fP the
first time.
.PP
\fIRotating dash.\fP If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a
rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indicator.
.PP
\fICd follows links.\fP This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander to
follow the logical chain of directories when changing current directory
either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behavior
of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the real directory
structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory through a link will
move you to the current directory's real parent and not to the directory
where the link was present.
.PP
\fISafe delete.\fP If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory
hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default
selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from "Yes" to
"No".  This option is disabled by default.
.PP
.\"NODE "    Layout"
\fIAuto save setup.\fP If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight
Commander the configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in
the ~/.config/mc/ini file.
.SH "    Layout"
The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout of
screen. The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "Panel
split", "Console output" and "Other options".
.PP
\fBPanel split\fP
.PP
The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You
can specify whether the area is split to the panels in
\fIVertical\fP
 or
\fIHorizontal\fP
direction. Panel layout can be changed using Alt\-, (Alt\-comma) shortcut.
.PP
\fIEqual split.\fP By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you
can specify an unequal split.
.PP
\fBConsole output\fP
.PP
On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are shown in
the output window. This option is available if Midnight Commander runs on
native console only.
.PP
\fBOther options\fP
.PP
\fIMenu bar visible.\fP If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is always
visible on the top row of screen above panels. Enabled by default.
.PP
\fICommand prompt.\fP If enabled, command line is avalable. Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIKeybar visible.\fP If enabled, 10 lables associated with F1\-F10 keys are
located at the bottom row of screen. Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIHintbar visible.\fP If enabled, the one\-line hints are visible below
panels. Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIXTerm window title.\fP When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight
Commander sets the terminal window title to the current working directory
and updates it when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you
see some incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off this
option.  Enabled by default.
.PP
.\"NODE "    Panel options"
\fIShow free space.\fP If enabled, free space and total space of current file
system is shown at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default.
.SH "    Panel options"
\fBMain panel options\fP
.PP
\fIShow mini\-status.\fP If enabled, one line of status information about the
currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels. Enabled by
default.
.PP
\fIUse SI size units.\fP If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use
SI units (powers of 1000)  when displaying any byte sizes. The suffixes (k,
m ...) are shown in lowercase.  If disabled (default), Midnight Commander
will use binary units (powers of 1024)  and the suffixes are shown in upper
case (K, M ...)
.PP
\fIMix all files.\fP If this option is enabled, all files and directories are
shown mixed together.  If the option is desabled (default), directories (and
links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other
files below.
.PP
\fIShow backup files.\fP If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show files
ending with a tilde.  Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls option
\-B). Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIShow hidden files.\fP If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show all files
that start with a dot (like ls \-a). Disabled by default.
.PP
\fIFast directory reload.\fP If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander
will use a trick to determine if the directory contents have changed.  The
trick is to reload the directory only if the i\-node of the directory has
changed; this means that reloads only happen when files are created or
deleted.  If what changes is the i\-node for a file in the directory (file
size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated.  In
these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory
manually (with C\-r). Disabled by default.
.PP
\fIMark moves down.\fP If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you
mark a file (with Insert key). Enabled by default.
.PP
\fIReverse files only.\fP Allow revert selection of files only. Enabled by
default.  If enabled, the reverse selection is applied to files only, not to
directories.  The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse
selection is applied to files as well to directories: all unselected items
become selected, and vice versa.
.PP
\fISimple swap.\fP If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means that
panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become right one, and vice
versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange its content
keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.
.PP
\fIAuto save panels setup.\fP If this option is enabled, when you exit the
Midnight Commander the current settings of panels are saved in the
~/.cache/mc/panels.ini file.  Disabled by default.
.PP
\fBNavigation\fP
.PP
\fILynx\-like motion.\fP If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys
to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the
shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.
.PP
\fIPage scrolling.\fP If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the
display when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel,
otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time.
.PP
\fIMouse page scrolling.\fP Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is
done by pages or line by line on the panels.
.PP
\fBFile highlight\fP

You can specify whether \fIpermissions\fP and \fIfile types\fP should be
highlighted with distinctive Colors\&.  If the permission highlighting is
enabled, the parts of the \fIperm\fP and \fImode\fP display fields which apply to
the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color defined
by the \fIselected\fP keyword.  If the file type highlighting is enabled, file
names are colored according to rules described in
@sysconfdir@/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames Highlight for more

In this dialog you configure the confirmation options for file deletion,
overwriting files, execution by pressing enter, quitting the program,
directory hotlist entries deletion and history cleanup.
 and.
.SH "    Display bits"
.\"NODE "    Learn keys"
This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen.
This setting may be 7\-bits if your terminal/curses supports only seven
output bits, ISO\-8859\-1 displays all the characters in the ISO\-8859\-1 map
and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8 bit
characters.
.SH "    Learn keys"
This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor arrows
and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal.  They often
don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.
.PP
You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h' left,
\&'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right).  Once you press any cursor movement key and
it is recognized, you can use that key as well.
.PP
You can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a key and
it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of that key.
Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the
first time will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it will
show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.  The Tab key should be
working always.
.PP
If some keys do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after
pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine it.  Do it by pressing
the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter or
Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a message box
will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait until the message
box disappears.  If you want to abort, just press Escape once and wait.
.PP
.\"NODE "    Virtual FS"
When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions for
the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM] section
of your ~/.config/mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current
terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working properly
are not saved.
.SH "    Virtual FS"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Virtual File System"
This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File
System\&.
.PP
The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of
the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the file
system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).
.PP
Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example,
compressed tar files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
uncompressed files on your disk.
.PP
Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up
resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached information to
decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to
frequently used file systems.
.PP
Because of the format of the tar archives, the \fITar filesystem\fP needs to
read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most tar files are
usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the tar
file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary location
and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.
.PP
Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it's
common that you will leave a tar file and then re\-enter it later.  Since
decompression is slow, the Midnight Commander will cache the information in
memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all the resources
associated with the file system are released.  The default timeout is set to
one minute.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"FTP File System"
The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP
servers.  It has several options.
.PP
\fIftp anonymous password\fP is the password used when you login as
"anonymous".  Some sites require a valid e\-mail address.  On the other hand,
you probably don't want to give your real e\-mail address to untrusted sites,
especially if you are not using spam filtering.
.PP
ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache.
The cache expire time is configurable with the \fIftpfs directory cache
timeout\fP option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation
on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the
FTP server.
.PP
You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern
firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP
proxies are considered obsolete.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"FTP File System"
If \fIAlways use ftp proxy\fP is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to
enable proxy for certain hosts.  See FTP File System for examples.
.PP
If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the
@prefix@/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that are
local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and
to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly
accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the specified FTP
proxy.
.PP
You can enable using \fI~/.netrc\fP file, which keeps login names and passwords
for ftp servers.  See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc format.
.PP
.\"NODE "    Save Setup"
\fIUse passive mode\fP enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for
data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server.  This option is
recommended and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the data
connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some
firewalls.
.SH "    Save Setup"
At startup the Midnight Commander will try to load initialization
information from the ~/.config/mc/ini file. If this file doesn't exist, it
will load the information from the system\-wide configuration file, located
in @prefix@/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system\-wide configuration file doesn't
exist, MC uses the default settings.
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Left and Right Menus"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Options Menu"
The \fISave Setup\fP command creates the ~/.config/mc/ini file by saving the
current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus.

If you activate the \fIauto save setup\fP option, MC will always save the
current settings when exiting.
.PP

.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Macro Substitution"
.\"NODE "  The cd internal command"
If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, the Midnight
Commander checks the extension of the selected file against the extensions
in the Extensions File\&.  If a match is found then the code associated with
that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion takes place before
executing the command.
.SH "  The cd internal command"
The \fIcd\fP command is interpreted by the Midnight Commander, it is not passed
to the command shell for execution.  Thus it may not handle all of the nice
macro expansion and substitution that your shell does, although it does some
of them:
.PP
\fITilde substitution.\fP The (~) will be substituted with your home directory,
if you append a username after the tilde, then it will be substituted with
the login directory of the specified user.
.PP
For example, ~guest is the home directory for the user guest, while ~/guest
is the directory guest in your home directory.
.PP
\fIPrevious directory.\fP You can jump to the directory you were previously by
using the special directory name '\-' like this: \fBcd \-\fP
.PP
\fICDPATH directories.\fP If the directory specified to the \fBcd\fP command is
not in the current directory, then The Midnight Commander uses the value in
the environment variable \fBCDPATH\fP to search for the directory in any of the
named directories.
.PP
.\"NODE "  Macro Substitution"
For example you could set your \fBCDPATH\fP variable to ~/src:/usr/src,
allowing you to change your directory to any of the directories inside the
~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place in the file system by using
its relative name (for example cd linux could take you to /usr/src/linux).
.SH "  Macro Substitution"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Menu File Edit"
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
When accessing a user menu\&, or executing an extension dependent command\&,
or running a command from the command line input, a simple macro
substitution takes place.
.PP
The macros are:
.TP 
\fI%i\fP
The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column position.  For edit menu
only.
.TP 
\fI%y\fP
The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.
.TP 
\fI%k\fP
The block file name.
.TP 
\fI%e\fP
The error file name.
.TP 
\fI%m\fP
The current menu name.
.TP 
\fI%f\fP and \fI%p\fP
The current file name.
.TP 
\fI%x\fP
The extension of current file name.

.TP 
\fI%u\fP and \fI%U\fP
Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files are untagged.
You can use this macro only once per menu file entry or extension file
entry, because next time there will be no tagged files.
.TP 
\fI%s\fP and \fI%S\fP
The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current

.TP 
\fI%cd\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Virtual File System"
This is a special macro that is used to change the current directory to the
directory specified in front of it.  This is used primarily as an interface
to the Virtual File System\&.
.TP 
\fI%view\fP
This macro is used to invoke the internal viewer.  This macro can be used
alone, or with arguments.  If you pass any arguments to this macro, they
should be enclosed in brackets.
.IP
The arguments are: \fIascii\fP to force the viewer into ascii mode; \fIhex\fP to
force the viewer into hex mode; \fInroff\fP to tell the viewer that it should
interpret the bold and underline sequences of nroff; \fIunformatted\fP to tell
the viewer to not interpret nroff commands for making the text bold or
underlined.
.TP 
\fI%%\fP
The % character
.TP 
\fI%{some text}\fP
Prompt for the substitution. An input box is shown and the text inside the

.\"NODE "  The subshell support"
If environment variable \fIENV\fP is unset, the \fIdefault\fP is substituted.
Otherwise, the value of \fIENV\fP is substituted.
.SH "  The subshell support"
The subshell support is a compile time option, that works with the shells:
bash, tcsh and zsh.
.PP
When the subshell code is activated the Midnight Commander will spawn a
concurrent copy of your shell (the one defined in the \fBSHELL\fP variable and
if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a
pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you execute a
command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed it.
This also allows you to change the environment variables, use shell
functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit the Midnight
Commander.
.PP
If you are using \fBbash\fP you can specify startup commands for the subshell
in your ~/.local/share/mc/bashrc file and special keyboard maps in the
~/.local/share/mc/inputrc file.  \fBtcsh\fP users may specify startup commands
in the ~/.local/share/mc/tcshrc file.
.PP
When the subshell code is used, you can suspend applications at any time
with the sequence C\-o and jump back to the Midnight Commander, if you
interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other external
commands until you quit the application you interrupted.
.PP
An extra added feature of using the subshell is that the prompt displayed by
the Midnight Commander is the same prompt that you are currently using in
your shell.

.PP
The Chmod window has two parts \- \fIPermissions\fP and \fIFile\fP.
.PP
In the File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and its
permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and group.
.PP
In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons which correspond
to the file attribute bits.  As you change the attribute bits, you can see
the octal value change in the File section.
.PP
To move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the \fIarrow

.PP
To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.
.PP
When working with a group of files or directories, you just click on the

.SH "File Operations"
When you copy, move or delete files the Midnight Commander shows the file
operations dialog.  It shows the files currently being processed and uses up
to three progress bars.  The file bar indicates the percentage of the
current file that has been processed so far.  The count bar shows how many
of the tagged files have been handled.  The bytes bar indicates the
percentage of the total size of the tagged files that has been handled.  If
the verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not shown.
.PP
There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip button
will skip the rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort button will abort
the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.
.PP
There are three other dialogs which you can run into during the file
operations.
.PP
The error dialog informs about error conditions and has three choices.
Normally you select either the Skip button to skip the file or the Abort
button to abort the operation altogether.  You can also select the Retry
button if you fixed the problem from another terminal.
.PP
The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on the

files.  Press the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No button to skip
the file, the All button to overwrite all the files, the None button to
never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the source file is
newer than the target file.  You can abort the whole operation by pressing
the Abort button.

which is not empty.  Press the Yes button to delete the directory
recursively, the No button to skip the directory, the All button to delete
all the directories and the None button to skip all the non\-empty
directories.  You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort
button.  If you selected the Yes or All button you will be asked for a
confirmation.  Type "yes" only if you are really sure you want to do the
recursive delete.
.PP
.\"NODE "Mask Copy/Rename"
If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the files on
which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files are
left tagged.
.SH "Mask Copy/Rename"
The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an easy
way.  To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and usually in
the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.  All the files
matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask.
If there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask
are renamed.
.PP
There are other options which you can set:
.PP
\fBFollow links\fP
.PP
determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory
(recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or whether
would you like to copy their content.
.PP
\fBDive into subdirs\fP
.PP
determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but
the target directory already exists.  The default action is to copy the
contents of the source directory into the target directory.  Enabling this
option causes copying the source directory itself into the target directory.
.PP
For example, you want to copy directory \fI/foo\fP containing file \fIbar\fP to
\fI/bla/foo\fP, which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when \fBDive
into subdirs\fP is not set), mc would copy file \fI/foo/bar\fP into the file
\fI/bla/foo/bar\fP.  By enabling this option the \fI/bla/foo/foo\fP directory will
be created, and \fI/foo/bar\fP will be copied into \fI/bla/foo/foo/bar\fP.
.PP
\fBPreserve attributes\fP
.PP
determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are
root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option is not set, the
current value of the umask will be respected.
.PP
\fBUse shell patterns on\fP
.PP
When the shell patterns option is on you can use the '*' and '?' wildcards
in the source mask.  They work like they do in the shell.  In the target
mask only the '*' and '\e<digit>' wildcards are allowed.  The first
\&'*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in
the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the second group and so on.
The '\e1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source
mask, the '\e2' wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the
way up to '\e9'.  The '\e0' wildcard is the whole filename of the source
file.
.PP
Two examples:
.PP
If the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the
file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".
.PP
Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would
become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this is "*.*" and the
destination is "\e2.\e1".
.PP
\fBUse shell patterns off\fP
.PP
When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic grouping
anymore. You must use '\e(...\e)' expressions in the source mask to specify
meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexible but also
requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the situation
when the shell patterns option is on.
.PP
Two examples:
.PP
If the source mask is "^\e(.*\e)\e.tar\e.gz$", the destination is
"/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be
"/bla/foo.tgz".
.PP
Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" will
become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is
"^\e(.*\e)\e.\e(.*\e)$" and the destination is "\e2.\e1".
.PP
\fBCase Conversions\fP
.PP
You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\eu' or '\el' in
the target mask, the next character will be converted to uppercase or
lowercase correspondingly.
.PP
If you use '\eU' or '\eL' in the target mask, the next characters will be
converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the next '\eE' or
next '\eU', '\eL' or the end of the file name.
.PP
The '\eu' and '\el' are stronger than '\eU' and '\eL'.
.PP
For example, if the source mask is '*' (shell patterns on) or '^\e(.*\e)$'
(shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\eL\eu*' the file names will be
converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.
.PP
You can also use '\e' as a quote character. For example, '\e\e' is a
backslash and '\e*' is an asterisk.
.PP
\fBStable symlinks\fP
.PP
commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target,
so that they'll point to the same location as it did before. With absolute
symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will
recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts and
making the value as short as possible (most modern filesystems keep short
symlinks inside inodes and thus don't waste much disk space).

appear most often in preformatted manual pages, are displayed bold and
underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.
.PP
When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and constant
numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly after removing the quotes.  Each
number matches one byte.  You can mix quoted text with constants like this:

The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do
what, just consult the appropriate pull\-down menu. Other keys are: Shift
movement keys do text highlighting.  \fBCtrl\-Ins\fP copies to the file
\fBmcedit.clip\fP and \fBShift\-Ins\fP pastes from mcedit.clip.  \fBShift\-Del\fP cuts
to \fBmcedit.clip\fP, and \fBCtrl\-Del\fP deletes highlighted text. Mouse
highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by holding
down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse
highlighting work.
.PP
To define a macro, press \fBCtrl\-R\fP and then type out the key strokes you
want to be executed. Press \fBCtrl\-R\fP again when finished. You can then
assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is
executed when you press \fBCtrl\-A\fP and then the assigned key. The macro is
also executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided
that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined, the macro
commands go into the file \fB~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros\fP You can
delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file.
.PP
To change charset of displayed text may use M\-e (Alt\-e).  Recoding is made
from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may
select "<No translation>" in charset selection dialog.
.PP
\fBF19\fP will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or \fBC\fP or

ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the
following action depends on the setting of the \fIComplete: show all\fP option
in the Configuration dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities
pops up next to the current position and you can select with the arrow keys
and \fBEnter\fP the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in
which the possibilities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and
complete as much as possible.  If you press \fBAlt\-Tab\fP again, only the
subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the first item which matches
all the previous characters will be highlighted.  As soon as there is no
ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by canceling keys \fBEsc\fP,
\fBF10\fP and left and right arrow keys. If Complete: show all is disabled, the
dialog pops up only if you press \fBAlt\-Tab\fP for the second time, for the
first time MC just beeps.
.SH "Virtual File System"
The Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file
system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch.  The
virtual file system switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipulate files
not located on the Unix file system.
.PP
Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File Systems
(VFS): the \fIlocal\fP file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file
system; the \fIftpfs\fP, used to manipulate files on remote systems with the
FTP protocol; the \fItarfs\fP, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files;
the \fIundelfs\fP, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the
default file system for Linux systems), \fIfish\fP (for manipulating files over
shell connections such as rsh and ssh).  If the code was compiled with
\fIsmbfs\fP support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB
(CIFS)  protocol.
.PP
A generic \fIextfs\fP (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to
easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.
.PP
.\"NODE "  FTP File System"
The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will
forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of
the file systems is described later in their own section.
.SH "  FTP File System"
The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote
machines.  To actually use it, you can use the \fIFTP link\fP item in the menu
or directly change your current directory using the \fIcd\fP command to a path
name that looks like this:
.PP
\fIftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote\-dir]\fP
.PP
The \fIuser\fP, \fIport\fP and \fIremote\-dir\fP elements are optional.  If you
specify the \fIuser\fP element, the Midnight Commander will login to the remote
machine as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login
name from the \fI~/.netrc\fP file.  The optional \fIpass\fP element is the
password used for the connection.  Using the password in the VFS directory
name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear text
and can be saved to the directory history.
.PP
To enable using FTP proxy, prepend \fB!\fP (an exclamation sign) to the
hostname.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf

.\"NODE "  Tar File System"
Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for ftpfs options.
.SH "  Tar File System"
The tar file system provides you with read\-only access to your tar files and
compressed tar files by using the chdir command.  To change your directory
to a tar file, you change your current directory to the tar file by using
the following syntax:
.PP
\fI/filename.tar/utar://[dir\-inside\-tar]\fP
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means that
usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter into the tar
file, see the Extension File Edit section for details on how this is done.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
    mc\-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc\-3.0/vfs

.fi
.PP
.\"NODE "  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem"
The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.
.SH "  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem"
The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you to
manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use this,
the other side has to either run fish server, or has to have bash\-compatible
shell.
.PP
To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special
directory which name is in the following format:
.PP
\fIsh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote\-dir]\fP
.PP
The \fIuser,\fP \fIoptions\fP and \fIremote\-dir\fP elements are optional.  If you
specify the \fIuser\fP element, the Midnight Commander will try to login on the
remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.
.PP
The available \fIoptions\fP are:
.nf
  'C' \- use compression;
  'r' \- use rsh instead of ssh;
  port \- specify the port used by remote server.
.fi
If the \fIremote\-dir\fP element is present, your current directory on the
remote machine will be set to this one.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
    sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
    sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
    sh://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
    sh://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private
.fi
.\"NODE "  Undelete File System"
.SH "  Undelete File System"
On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete
facilities, you will have the undelete file system available.  Recovery of
deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The undelete file
system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve all of the
deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the selected
files into a regular partition.
.PP
To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name formed
by the "undel://" prefix and the file name where the actual file system
resides.
.PP
For example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the first
SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:
.PP
.nf
    undel://sda2
.fi
.PP
.\"NODE "  SMB File System"
It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information before
you start browsing files there.
.SH "  SMB File System"
The smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote machines with SMB (or
CIFS) protocol.  These include Windows for Workgroups, Windows 9x/ME/XP,
Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Samba.  To actually use it, you may try to use
the panel command "SMB link..." (accessible from the menubar) or you may
directly change your current directory to it using the cd command to a path
name that looks like this:
.PP
\fIsmb://[user@]machine[/service][/remote\-dir]\fP
.PP
The \fIuser\fP, \fIservice\fP and \fIremote\-dir\fP elements are optional.  The

.\"NODE "  EXTernal File System"
.SH "  EXTernal File System"
\fBextfs\fP allows to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU
Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.
.PP
Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:
.PP
1. Stand\-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing
file.  They represent certain system\-wide data as a directory tree.  You can
invoke them by typing '\fIcd fsname://\fP' where fsname is an extfs short name
(see below).  Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio tracks
on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).
.PP
For example, to list CD\-Audio tracks on your CD\-ROM drive, type
.PP
.nf
  cd audio://
.fi
.PP
2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent
contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real' files
compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a
mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such filesystems
\&'\fIfsname://\fP' should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the
archive itself can be on another vfs.
.PP
For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type
.PP
.nf
  cd documents.zip/uzip://
.fi
.PP
In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For
instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory
history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell commands
inside extfs, just like any other non\-local VFS.
.PP
Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:
.TP 
\fBa\fP
access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (\fIcd a://\fP).
.TP 
\fBapt\fP
front end to Debian's APT package management system (\fIcd apt://\fP).
.TP 
\fBaudio\fP

archivers (\fIcd archive/xxxx://\fP where xxxx is one of: \fIulha\fP, \fIurar\fP,
\fIuzip\fP, \fIuzoo\fP, \fIuar\fP, \fIuha\fP).
.PP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the
Extension File Edit section.  Here is an example entry for Debian packages:
.PP
.nf
  regex/.deb$
          Open=%cd %p/deb://

.\"NODE "Colors"
.SH Colors
The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports color
using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it gets
confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the \-c and
\-b flag respectively.
.PP
If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of ncurses,
it will also check the variable \fBCOLORTERM,\fP if it is set, it has the same
effect as the \-c flag.
.PP
You may specify terminals that always force color mode by adding the
\fIcolor_terminals\fP variable to the Colors section of the initialization
file.  This will prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect if
your terminal supports color.  Example:
.PP
.nf

.fi
.PP
The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does not
provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in the
terminal database.
.PP
The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors.
Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable
\fBMC_COLOR_TABLE\fP or the Colors section in the initialization file.
.PP
In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the
\fIbase_color\fP variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a
terminal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:
.PP
.nf
[Colors]
base_color=
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
.fi
.PP
The format for the color definition is:
.PP
.nf
  <keyword>=<fgcolor>,<bgcolor>,<attributes>:<keyword>=...
.fi
.PP
The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled,
marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged,
commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory,
commandhistory. Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar
color: statusbar. Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel,
menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus,
dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus,
errdtitle.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink,
helpslink, helptitle.  Viewer color are: viewbold, viewunderline,
viewselected.  Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked,
editwhitespace, editlinestate.  Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal,
pmenusel, pmenutitle.
.PP
\fIheader\fP determines the color of panel header, the line that contains
column titles and sort mode indicator.
.PP
\fIinput\fP determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.
.PP
\fIgauge\fP determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar
(gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file operations,
such as copying.
.PP
\fIdisabled\fP determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.
.PP
The dialog boxes use the following colors: \fIdnormal\fP is used for the normal
text, \fIdfocus\fP is the color used for the currently selected component,
\fIdhotnormal\fP is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal
components, whereas the \fIdhotfocus\fP color is used for the highlighted color
in the currently selected component.
.PP
Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot,
menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead.
.PP
Help uses the following colors: \fIhelpnormal\fP is used for normal text,
\fIhelpitalic\fP is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual
page, \fIhelpbold\fP is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual
page, \fIhelplink\fP is used for not selected hyperlinks and \fIhelpslink\fP is
used for selected hyperlink.
.PP
Popup menu uses following colors: \fIpmenunormal\fP is used for non\-selected
menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, \fIpmenusel\fP is used for
selected menu item, \fIpmenutitle\fP is used for popup menu title.
.PP
The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen,
brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan,
lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent
background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used for background
color. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main colors.  When 256
colors are available, they can be specified either as color16 to color255,
or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:
.PP
.nf
[Colors]
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default
.fi
.PP
Attributes can be any of bold, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a
plus sign if more than one are desired.  The special word "none" means no
attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color.  Example:
.PP
.nf
menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline
.fi

.\"NODE "Skins"

.\"NODE "Special Settings"
.SH "Special Settings"
Most of the Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the
menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be
changed by editing the setup file.
.PP
These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file:
.TP 
\fIclear_before_exec\fP
By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a
command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the bottom
of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the
field clear_before_exec to 0.
.TP 
\fIconfirm_view_dir\fP
If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If this
flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing the
directory if you have files tagged.
.TP 
\fIftpfs_retry_seconds\fP
This value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will wait before
attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the login.  If the
value is zero, the login will no be retried.
.TP 
\fImax_dirt_limit\fP
Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal
file viewer.  Normally this value is not significant, because the code
automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate of
incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow machines or terminals with a
fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.
.IP
It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and
that is the default value.
.TP 
\fImouse_move_pages_viewer\fP
Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the
internal file viewer.
.TP 
\fIonly_leading_plus_minus\fP
Allow special treatment for '+', '\-', '*' in the command line (select,
unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty.  You don't
need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line.  On the
other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the command line is
not empty.
.TP 
\fIshow_output_starts_shell\fP
This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support.  When
you use the C\-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this one is set,
you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back
to the Midnight Commander.
.TP 
\fItimeformat_recent\fP
Change the time format used to display dates less than 6 months from now.
See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If this option
is absent, default timeformat is used.
.TP 
\fItimeformat_old\fP
Change the time format used to display dates older than 6 months from now or
for dates in the future.  See strftime or date man page for the format
specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.
.TP 
\fItorben_fj_mode\fP
If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly different
on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first and last files
in the panels, they will act as follows:
.IP
The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top
line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go to the
first file in the panel.
.IP
The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it;
else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom line, in
such case it will move the selection to the last file name in the panel.
.TP 
\fIuse_file_to_guess_type\fP
.\"LINK2"
.\"Extension File Edit"
If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match
the file types listed on the mc.ext file\&.
.TP 
\fIxtree_mode\fP
If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a
Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the contents
of the selected directory.
.TP 
\fIfish_directory_timeout\fP
This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The
default value is 900 seconds.
.TP 
\fIclipboard_store\fP
This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility
like 'xclip' to read text into X selection from file.  For example:
.PP
.nf
clipboard_store=xclip \-i
.fi
.TP 
\fIclipboard_paste\fP
This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility
like 'xclip' to print the selection to standard out.  For example:
.PP
.nf
clipboard_pastee=xclip \-o
.fi
.TP 
\fIautodetect_codeset\fP
This option allows use the `enca' command to autodetect codeset of text
files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values can be obtain by
the `enca \-\-list languages | cut \-d : \-f1' command. Option must be located
in the [Misc] section.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.nf
autodetect_codeset=russian
.fi
.\"NODE "Terminal databases"
.SH "Terminal databases"
The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal database
without requiring root privileges.  The Midnight Commander searches in the
system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in the Midnight
Commander library directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for the
section "terminal:your\-terminal\-name" and then for the section
"terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that you
want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.
You can use the special \ee form to represent the escape character and the
^x to represent the control\-x character.
.PP
The possible key symbols are:
.PP
.nf
f0 to f20     Function keys f0\-f20
bs            backspace
home          home key
end           end key
up            up arrow key
down          down arrow key
left          left arrow key
right         right arrow key
pgdn          page down key
pgup          page up key
insert        the insert character
delete        the delete character
complete      to do completion
.fi
.PP
For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set
this in the ini file:
.PP
.nf
insert=\ee[Op
.fi

.PP
Also now you can use \fIextended learn keys.\fP For example:

.nf
    ctrl\-alt\-right=\ee[[1;6C
    ctrl\-alt\-left=\ee[[1;6D
.fi

.PP
This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a \ee[[1;6D escape sequence and
therefore Midnight Commander interprets "\ee[[1;6D" as Ctrl\-Alt\-Left.

.PP
The \fIcomplete\fP key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke
the completion process, this is invoked with Alt\-tab, but you can define
other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and
unused keys everywhere).
